/*  GC Sharing pass.
    This pass is invoked only if the heap sizing code detects that heap space
    is running very short because it adds a very considerable overhead to GC.
    It aims to reduce the size of the live data in a similar way to the data
    sharing function PolyML.shareCommonData by merging immutable cells that
    contain data that cannot be distinguished.

    This version of the code now does a deep structure merge in a similar
    way to the full sharing function. This code first does a full pass
    over the heap creating lists of cells that could possibly be merged.
    There are separate lists for byte and word objects up to a fixed
    size.  Larger objects and other objects are not considered. Because
    all the items in a list have the same length and type (flag bits)
    we can use the length word to link the items in the list.  A
    consequence of this is that positive long precision values can be
    shared but negative values cannot.  

    There is a sharing function that first distributes items into a
    hash table.  Then each hash table is sorted and as part of the
    sorting process cells with the same contents are merged.  One
    cell is chosen and the length words on the others are set to be
    forwarding pointers to the chosen cell.  Hashing allows for easy
    parallel processing.

    The structure sharing code works by first sharing the byte
    data which cannot contain pointers.  Then the word data is processed
    to separate out "tail" cells that contain only tagged integers or
    pointers to cells that either cannot be merged, such as mutables,
    or those that have already been processed, such as the byte data.
    Any pointers to shared data are updated to point to the merged cell.
    The tail cells are then sorted and shared using the sharing function
    and become part of the "processed" set.  This process is repeated to
    find cells that are now tails and so on.

    Compared with the full sharing code this is expensive since it
    requires repeated scans of the list of unprocessed cells.  In
    particular there may be cells that form loops (basically closures
    for mutually recusive functions) and if they are present they and
    anything that points directly or indirectly at them will never
    be removed from the list.  We stop when it appears that we are
    not making progress and simply do a final bit-wise share of the
    remainder.
