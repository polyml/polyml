<P>Earlier versions of Poly/ML have provided a form of concurrent execution through 
  the Process structure. Version 5.1 introduces 
  new thread primitives in the Thread structure. This structure is modelled on 
  the Posix thread (pthread) package but simplified and modified for ML. The aim 
  is to provide an efficient implementation of parallelism particularly to enable 
  ML programs to make use of multi-core processors while minimising the changes 
  needed to existing code. The Process structure will continue to be available 
  as a library written on top of these primitives but new programs should use 
  the Thread structure directly. </P>
<P>The thread package differs from pthreads in a number of ways. 
There is no join function to wait for the completion of a thread. 
This can be written using mutexes and condition variables. 
Cancellation and signal handling are combined into the interrupt
functions. (The Poly/ML Signal structure handles signals for all the
threads together).  The effect of explicit cancellation is achieved
using the interrupt function.  This causes an interrupt to be
generated in a specific thread.  Alternatively an interrupt can be
broadcast to all threads.  This is most likely to be used
interactively to kill threads that appear to have gone out of
control.  The normal top-level handler for a console interrupt will
generate this.  Threads can choose how or whether they respond to
these interrupts.  A thread that is doing processor-intensive work
probably needs to be able to be interrupted asynchronously whereas if
it is communicating with other threads the presence of asynchronous
interrupts makes correct programming difficult.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The type of a thread attribute. Thread attributes are
properties of the thread that are set initially when the thread is
created but can subsequently be modified by the thread itself.  The
thread attribute type may be extended in the future to include things
like scheduling priority. The current thread attributes control the
way interrupt exceptions are delivered to the thread.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">EnableBroadcastInterrupt
controls whether the thread will receive an interrupt sent using
broadcastInterrupt or as a result of pressing the console interrupt
key. If this is false the thread will not receive them.  The default
for a new thread if this is not specified is false.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <p>InterruptState controls when and whether interrupts are delivered to the 
    thread. This includes broadcast interrupts and also interrupts directed at 
    a specific thread with the interrupt call. InterruptDefer means the thread 
    will not receive any interrupts. However, if the thread has previously been 
    interrupted the interrupt may be delivered when the thread calls setAttributes 
    to change its interrupt state. InterruptSynch means interrupts are delivered 
    synchronously. An interrupt will be delayed until an interruption point. An 
    interruption point is one of: testInterrupt, ConditionVar.wait, ConditionVar.waitUntil 
    and various library calls that may block, such as IO calls, pause etc. N.B. 
    Mutex.lock is not an interruption point even though it can result in a thread 
    blocking for an indefinite period. InterruptAsynch means interrupts are delivered 
    asynchronously i.e. at a suitable point soon after they are triggered. InterruptAsynchOnce 
    means that only a single interrupt is delivered asynchronously after which 
    the interrupt state is changed to InterruptSynch. It allows a thread to tidy 
    up and if necessary indicate that it has been interrupted without the risk 
    of a second asynchronous interrupt occurring in the handler for the first 
    interrupt. If this attribute is not specified when a thread is created the 
    default is InterruptSynch.</p>
  <p>MaximumMLStack was added in version 5.5.3. It controls the maximum size the 
    ML stack may grow to. It is an option type where NONE allows the stack to 
    grow to the limit of the available memory whereas SOME n limits the stack 
    to n words. This is approximate since there is some rounding involved. When 
    the limit is reached the thread is sent an Interrupt exception.</p>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Mutex substructure</font></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A mutex provides simple mutual exclusion. A thread 
  can lock a mutex and until it unlocks it no other thread will be able to lock 
  it. Locking and unlocking are intended to be fast in the situation when there 
  is no other process attempting to lock the mutex. Mutexes are non-recursive: 
  if a thread tries to lock a mutex that it has already locked it will deadlock. 
  Note: a thread should never attempt to lock or unlock a mutex if it may receive 
  an asynchronous interrupt. It should always set its interrupt state to either 
  InterruptDefer or InterruptSynch before calling these functions. An asynchronous 
  interrupt may leave the mutex in an indeterminate state.</P>

<PRE><STRONG>val</STRONG> mutex: unit -&gt; mutex</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Create a new mutex.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>val</STRONG> lock: mutex -&gt; unit</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Lock a mutex. If the mutex is currently locked the thread is blocked 
  until it is unlocked. If a thread tries to lock a mutex that it has previously 
  locked the thread will deadlock. N.B. &quot;lock&quot; is not an interruption 
  point (a point where synchronous interrupts are delivered) even though a thread 
  can be blocked indefinitely. If the thread attempting to lock the mutex is handling 
  interrupts asynchronously an asynchronous interrupt may be delivered before 
  or after the lock is taken.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><STRONG>val</STRONG> unlock: mutex -&gt; unit</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
Unlock a mutex and allow any waiting threads to run. The behaviour if
the mutex was not previously locked by the calling thread is
undefined.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><STRONG>val</STRONG> trylock: mutex -&gt; bool</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
Attempt to lock the mutex without blocking. Returns true if the mutex
was not previously locked and has now been locked by the calling
thread. Returns false if the mutex was previously locked, including
by the calling thread.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ConditionVar substructure</font></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Condition variables. Condition
variables are used to provide communication between threads. A
condition variable is used in conjunction with a mutex and usually a
reference to establish and test changes in state. The normal use is
for one thread to lock a mutex, test the reference and then wait on
the condition variable, releasing the lock on the mutex while it does
so. Another thread may then lock the mutex, update the reference,
unlock the mutex, and signal the condition variable. This wakes up
the first thread and reacquires the lock allowing the thread to test
the updated reference with the lock held. More complex communication
mechanisms, such as blocking channels, can be written in terms of
condition variables.

<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><STRONG>val</STRONG> wait: conditionVar * Mutex.mutex -&gt; unit</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <p>Release the mutex and block until the condition variable is signalled. When 
    wait returns the mutex will have been re-acquired.</p>
  <p>If the thread is handling interrupts synchronously this function can be interrupted 
    using the &quot;Thread.interrupt&quot; function or, if the thread is set to 
    accept broadcast interrupts, &quot;Thread.broadcastInterrupt&quot;. The thread 
    will re-acquire the mutex before the exception is delivered. An exception 
    will only be delivered in this case if the interrupt is sent before the condition 
    variable is signalled. If the interrupt is sent after the condition variable 
    is signalled the function will return normally even if it has not yet re-acquired 
    the mutex. The interrupt state will be delivered on the next call to &quot;wait&quot;, 
    &quot;Thread.testInterrupt&quot; or other blocking call.</p>
  <p>A thread should never call this function if it may receive an asynchronous 
    interrupt. It should always set its interrupt state to either InterruptSynch 
    or InterruptDefer beforehand. An asynchronous interrupt may leave the condition 
    variable and the mutex in an indeterminate state and could lead to deadlock.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>A condition variable should only be associated with one mutex at a time. 
    All the threads waiting on a condition variable should pass the same mutex 
    as argument.</p>

<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><STRONG>val</STRONG> waitUntil: conditionVar * Mutex.mutex * Time.time -&gt; bool</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> As wait except that it blocks until either the condition variable 
  is signalled or the time (absolute) is reached. Either way the mutex is reacquired 
  so there may be a further delay if it is held by another thread. Returns true 
  if the condition variable had been signalled and false if the time had expired 
  before the variable was signalled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
