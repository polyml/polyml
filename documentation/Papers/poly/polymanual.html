<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2> 
<p>Poly is a general purpose high-level programming language. It has a simple
  type system which is also very powerful. Higher order procedures, polymorphic
  operations, parameterised abstract types and modules are all supported by a
  single mechanism.</p>
<p>Poly is <strong>strongly</strong> typed. All objects have a <strong>signature</strong> which
  the compiler can use to check that operations applied to them are sensible.
  Type errors cannot cause run time faults.</p>
<p>The language is <strong>safe</strong>. Any faults that occur at run time will result in
  exceptions which can be caught and handled by the user. All variables must be
  initialised before they are used so faults due to undefined variables cannot
  occur.</p>
<p>Poly allows <strong>higher</strong> order procedures to be declared and used. A higher
  order procedure is one which takes a procedure as a parameter or returns a
  procedure as its result. Since Poly is <strong>statically</strong> scoped (the value
  bound to an identifier is determined by the static block structure) the
  procedure that is returned may refer to the arguments and local values
  belonging to the procedure that returned it, even though that procedure is no
  longer active.</p>
<p>Poly allows <strong>polymorphic</strong> operations. For example, in many languages such
  as Pascal or MODULA-2 programs to sort arrays of integers, arrays of strings
  or arrays of real numbers are textually almost identical. They differ only in
  the actual operation used to compare two elements of the array. In Poly one
  program can be written which will sort arrays of any type provided elements
  can be compared.</p>
<p>Poly allows <strong>abstract</strong> types to be created and manipulated. 
  A&quot;hash table&quot; type can be defined that allows an arbitrary object 
  to be stored along with a string which acts as a key. There would be a look-up 
  function that will return the object stored with a given key. These can be written 
  so that only the functions to create a table, enter a value against a key, and 
  return the value with the key, are available to the user of the hash table. 
  This has the advantages that the writer of the hash table function can change 
  the <strong>way</strong> it is implemented provided it has the same <strong>external</strong> 
  properties. The user can make use of the hash table knowing that he will not 
  be able to upset its internal structure by accidentally using a function which 
  was intended to be private.</p>
<p>Abstract types can be <strong>parameterised</strong> so that a set of types with similar
  properties can be defined in a single definition. A specific type can then be
  made from that. For example, a single hash table type could be declared from
  which hash tables to hold any particular type could be derived.</p>
<p>Types in Poly are similar to <strong>modules</strong> in other languages. For example,
  types can be separately compiled. An abstract type which makes use of other
  types can be written as though it were polymorphic - it will work if it is
  given any type (module) which has the required operations. Its operation may
  be simply to return a new type (module) as its result. This new type may be
  used directly or as a parameter to other polymorphic abstract types. There is
  a mechanism for constructing large programs out of their modules and
  recompiling those which have been modified since they were last compiled.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Chapter 2. The Type System</h2>
<p>The purpose of a type system is to avoid mistakes due to using a value in a
  way that was not intended, while making meaningful operations easy to express.
  For example, if we have two matrices with the same dimensions, it should be
  just as easy to write the instruction to add them together as if they were
  integers. However it should not be possible to add an integer to a matrix. A
  type system could be designed in which all these rules were built into the
  type checker. This has the problem that new types with new rules cannot be
  added in. A better way is to have a few simple rules which allow new types to
  be added and checked but which can be used to catch most of the faults which
  could be made. The Poly type system is based on this idea.</p>
<p>All objects have a <strong>signature</strong> which is checked by the type-checker.
  The signature corresponds to a <strong>type</strong> in other languages, but is more
  general to take account of the greater power of the type system. For example,
  in a language like Pascal, a parameter to a procedure may have type
  <em>integer</em>. This gives enough information for the compiler to check that
  the procedure is correctly used; it can only be applied to an integer value,
  but it does not specify precisely which value. It can be applied to 1, 2, 3
  etc. but not to strings such as "hello" or "goodbye". The checking done
  by the compiler ensures that certain kinds of faults will not happen when the
  program is run, but it cannot prevent all faults.</p>
<p>In Poly this approach is generalised to include procedures, types and exceptions
  as well
  as values. The signature of an object contains the information which the
  compiler uses to check that it is correctly used without restricting it to
  precisely one object. Expressions and variables can be made to return any
  kind of object and the signature of the result can be worked out by the
  compiler, provided of course that all the signatures in the expression
  match. Specifications have a standard textual form which allows them to be
  written in a program or output by the compiler. The rules for matching each
  kind of signature and their textual forms are described below.</p>
<h3>2.1. Values</h3>

<p>The simplest kind of object is the <strong>value</strong> which can be operated 
  on but does not do anything itself. Examples are the number 42 or the string 
  &quot;hello&quot;. A value is said to <strong>belong</strong> to a type or <strong>have</strong> 
  a particular type, which in Poly is always a named type. The signature is the 
  name of the type. For example, the signature of the number 42 is <em>integer</em> 
  and that of &quot;hello&quot; is <em>string</em>. Two values only match if they 
  belong to the same type. </p>

  <tr>
    <td><p>&lt;value signature&gt; ::= &lt;identifier&gt; |&lt;value signature&gt;$&lt;identifier&gt;</p>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>2.2. Procedures</h3>
<p><strong>Procedures</strong> are objects which perform a computation. They often 
  take <strong>parameters</strong> which can be used by the procedure and always 
  return a <strong>result</strong>. They may also have <strong>side-effects</strong> 
  or raise <strong>exceptions</strong>. Examples of procedures are "+" which adds 
  together two values and "<em>print</em>" which prints a value. "+" is an infix 
  operator which takes two values as parameters, and returns a single result. 
</p>
<p>3 + 4</p>
<p>"<em>print</em>" is a procedure which has the side-effect of printing the value.</p>
<p><em>print</em>(3+4);</p>
<p>prints out the value 7. It incidentally also produces a result, but it has 
  type <em>void</em> which has only one value, and is ignored.</p>
<p>Procedures can take procedures or types as parameters as well as simple values 
  and can also return them as results. Procedures match if their parameters and 
  results all match. The various forms of procedures will be described in the 
  section on the procedure constructor.</p>

<h3>2.3. Types</h3>
Poly has a novel view of <strong>types</strong> in that they are treated as being 
objects as well as having a role in checking the signature of values. Each type 
has a set of objects associated with it and a <strong>type mark</strong>. The 
type mark is used purely by the compiler in checking the signatures of objects 
and corresponds to the notion of a type in other languages, while the set of objects 
makes a type in Poly very similar to a module. All types have both a set of objects 
(which may however be empty) and a type mark, but one or the other may be more 
important in different circumstances.
<h4>2.3.1. Sets of Objects</h4>
<p>As an example of the set of objects, the type <em>integer</em>
  has various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication
  etc. which can operate on values of the integer type.
  Any program which works on integers will ultimately be written in terms
  of these basic operations.
  Similarly the type <em>real</em>
  will have these operations along with others which convert between
  integer and real.</p>
<p>The signature of a type is the signature of the objects which
  make it up.
  Every object in a type has a name, and all the names in one type are
  different, although objects with the same name frequently exist in
  different types.
  So for instance, many types have a <em>print</em>
  procedure which takes as its parameter a value of the type, and prints it.</p>
<p>The name of an object in a type is intended to suggest the semantics of the 
  operation, but there is no guarantee that the + operations in all types are 
  commutative; in the type <em>string</em> it is used for concatenation. ( This 
  would require a completely new level of semantic checking which is outside the 
  scope of a conventional compiler. The CLEAR system [Burstall and Goguen] attempts 
  this kind of checking.).</p>
<p>Most of the objects in types are procedures, but a type can contain simple 
  values as well as other types. For instance there may be a <em>first</em> and 
  a <em>last</em> value which give the maximum and minimum values. There is a 
  distinction between objects which are <em>part</em> of the type and those which 
  been created by operations of it and are said to <em>belong</em> to the type 
  or <em>have</em> that type. For example, there is no 3 in the type <em>integer</em> 
  but the number 3 <em>has</em> type <em>integer</em>.</p>
<p>As types are regarded as sets it is reasonable to be able to take subsets or 
  select a particular object from a type. For example, </p>
<p><strong>type</strong> (<em>atype</em>)<em><br>
  x</em>, <em>y</em>: <em>atype</em>;<br>
  <em>add</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>atype</em>; <em>atype</em>)<em>atype</em>;<br>
  <em>sub</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>atype</em>; <em>atype</em>)<em>atype</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong> </p>
<p>this is the signature of a type with four objects, called <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, 
  <em>add</em> and <em>sub</em>. <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are both values of 
  this type, and <em>add</em> and <em>sub</em> are procedures which take a pair 
  of values, and return a value. The name <em>atype</em> in brackets after the 
  word <strong>type</strong> is the name used to represent the type itself inside 
  the type signature. This type will match any of the following</p>
<p><strong>type</strong> (<em>t</em>) { Only the name has changed }<br>
  <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>: <em>t</em>;<br>
  <em>add</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>t</em>; <em>t</em>)<em>t</em>;<br>
  <em>sub</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>t</em>; <em>t</em>)<em>t</em><br>
  <strong>end </strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>type</strong>
  (<em>atype</em>) { The objects are in a different order }<br>
  <em>sub</em>, <em>add</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>t</em>; <em>t</em>)<em>t</em>;<br>
  <em>y</em>: <em>t</em>;<br>
  <em>x</em>: <em>t</em>;<br>
  <strong>end</strong><br></p>
<p><strong>type</strong>
  (<em>at</em>) { A subset }<br>
  <em>x</em>: <em>at</em>;<br>
  <em>add</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>at</em>; <em>at</em>)<em>at</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br></p>
<p><strong>type</strong>
  (<em>atype</em>) { Another subset }<br>
  <em>add</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>atype</em>; <em>atype</em>)<em>atype</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br></p>
<p><strong>type</strong> { Another subset - No need for an internal name }<br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p>This last example is the empty type which matches any type. The text in curly 
  brackets is comment and ignored by the compiler.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Type Marks and the Specifications of Values</h4>

<p>The function of the <strong>type mark</strong> is in the checking of the
  signatures of values.
  Each type has a distinct type mark which is used to identify values which
  have that type.
  The signature of a value is simply the type mark of the type to
  which it belongs.
  Checking the signatures of two values to see if they match reduces to
  seeing if they are the same type mark, there is no question of comparing
  the signatures of the types themselves.</p>
<p>The reason is that there may be many types with the same signature (short and 
  long precision integers may have the same set of operations, +, &#8211; etc. 
  but they are different types). The compiler produces type marks in various circumstances 
  so as to guarantee that two different types will always have different type 
  marks. The converse of this is that there are many circumstances in which two 
  types which are in fact identical may have different type marks, and values 
  associated with them will be incompatible. An expression which returns a type 
  always has a type mark which differs from any other, in particular if an existing 
  type is bound to a new name then they will have different type marks. Values 
  which have the old type have a different type mark from the new one and so are 
  incompatible, despite the types being in fact identical.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Sets and Marks</h4>

<p>There are circumstances when one or other of the two ways of viewing a type 
  becomes more important. Some types are used only as collections of objects and 
  there are no values associated with them. The type mark for those types is irrelevant. 
  Equally there are occasions in which a type is used where the set of objects 
  is irrelevant. Any type matches the empty type "<strong>type</strong> <strong>end</strong>" 
  which has no objects in it. The type mark of the matching type is still there 
  and is used by the compiler.</p>
<p>This is important because of the matching rules for procedure parameters if 
  one or more is a type. A procedure which takes a type as a parameter may use 
  the formal parameter name in the signature of other parameters. For example 
  a procedure may have signature</p>
<p><em>aproc</em>: <strong>proc</strong>(<em>atype</em>: <strong>type</strong> 
  <strong>end</strong>; <em>x</em>: <em>atype</em>)<em>atype</em></p>
<p>This procedure takes two parameters, a type which may be any type, and a value 
  which has the same type as the <strong>actual</strong> parameter. Its result 
  also has this type. This kind of procedure is known as polymorphic. It can therefore 
  be applied to </p>
<p><em>aproc</em>(<em>integer</em>, 99)</p>
<p> in which case the result will have type <em>integer</em> or </p>
<p><em>aproc</em>(<em>string</em>, &quot;hello&quot;)</p>
<p>returning a string. This procedure might be the identity function which simply 
  returns its second parameter (the value) as its result. What is happening is 
  that the actual type parameter is matched to the formal parameter using the 
  matching rules for types (the formal parameter must be a subset of the actual 
  parameter), and then the type mark of the formal parameter is replaced with 
  the type mark of the actual parameter in the other parameters and the result. 
  The other parameters therefore match if they have the type mark of the actual 
  parameter. The signature of the result is obtained by replacing the formal parameter's 
  type mark by the actual parameter. It is also possible to obtain the type from 
  the type marks of values, and this is used to remove the need to explicitly 
  pass type parameters in many cases.</p>
<p>The reason for considering types both as sets and as marks is that it
  becomes possible to write polymorphic operations which make use of objects
  in types.
  For example a sorting procedure can be written which will work on any
  values provided they belong to a type whose values can be compared for
  ordering.
  How this is done will be described in detail in the section on procedures.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Expressions and Values</h2>

<p>The basic element of a Poly program is the <strong>expression</strong>.
  An expression has a value and a signature which ensures that the
  value is correctly used.
  Expressions consist of identifiers and constructors
  and operations on them, either procedure applications or selections from
  types.</p>
  
<h3>3.1. Identifiers</h3>

<p>An <strong>identifier</strong> is a name which represents an object. The binding 
  of a name to a particular object is made by a <strong>declaration</strong>. 
  An identifier may be any string of alphanumeric characters starting with a letter, 
  or a string of one or more "special" characters. The underline character "_" 
  is considered as an alphanumeric. Each of the following are identifiers, separated 
  by spaces.</p>
<p><em>a</em> <em>Message</em> <em>integer</em> <em>j</em> + := &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
  <em>L999a</em><br>
  <em>An_extremely_long_identifier</em></p>
<p>The "special" characters are often used for infix operators, but can be used 
  for anything. They are </p>
<p>! # %&amp; = - + * : &lt; &gt; / \ ? ~ ^ | . @</p>
<p>Certain words are <strong>reserved</strong> and cannot be used as identifiers 
  because they are used for special purposes. These are</p>

<h3>3.3. Constructors</h3>
<p><strong>Constructors</strong> make values from other values. There are general 
  constructors for procedures and types as well as three constructors which make 
  special kinds of types: <strong>records, unions, </strong> and <strong>structures</strong>. 
  There are also constructors for values which allow literal constants to be entered 
  in a program.
<p>1 999 &quot;hello&quot; 'A' 0xff 
<p>Literal constants are either numbers or strings of characters. Numbers are 
  strings of digits or letters starting with a digit, and strings are any sequence 
  of characters unclosed in quotation marks. By default numbers are converted 
  to type <strong>integer</strong> and strings to either <strong>char</strong> 
  if they are enclosed in single quotes ('), or <strong>string</strong> if they

<h3>3.4. Declarations</h3>

<p>The result of any expression can be bound to an identifier by a declaration. 
</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>result</em> == 4+3* 2;</p>
<p>The identifier <em>result</em> can be used in place of the value that is bound 
  to it.</p>
<p>result+6</p>
<p>will yield the value 16. As well as taking the value from the expression, the 
  identifier also inherits its signature. The signature of <em>result</em> is 
  therefore <em>integer</em>. This works for any expression including those which 
  yield procedures or types. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>p</em> == <em>print</em>;</p>
<p>declares <em>p</em> to be the same as <em>print</em> so </p>
<p><em>p</em> 10;</p>
<p>will print the value 10.</p>
<p>An explicit signature may be given for an identifier.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>i</em>: <em>integer</em> == 10;</p>
<p>The result of the expression must have this signature for the compiler to allow 
  it. It is useful if a complex expression is being bound to an identifier to 
  check the signature of the result when it is being bound rather than when it 
  is used.</p>
<p>The identifier in an ordinary declaration is declared <strong>after</strong> 
  the expression is evaluated. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>i</em> == <em>i</em>+1</p>
<p> is valid provided <em>i</em> has been declared before. However when recursive 
  procedures or types are being declared a different kind of declaration is needed. 
</p>
<p><strong>letrec</strong> <em>p</em> == .... </p>
<p><strong>letrec</strong> introduces a recursive declaration, and the <em>p</em> 
  used in the expression will be the <em>p</em> that is being declared. Recursive 
  declarations can only be used for procedures or types and will be described 
  in more detail below.</p>
<p>Several declarations can be grouped together with <strong>and</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>a</em> == 1 <strong>and</strong> <em>b</em> == 2</p>
<p>This declares both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. Grouping declarations together 
  in this way is useful for mutually recursive declarations.</p>
<p><strong>letrec</strong> <em>p</em> == .... <strong>and</strong> <em>q</em> 
  == ....</p>

<h3>3.5. Blocks</h3>
<p>Commands can be grouped by enclosing them in the bracketing symbols <strong>begin</strong> 
  and <strong>end</strong> or <strong>(</strong> and <strong>)</strong>. </p>
<p>2* (3+4);</p>
<p><strong>begin</strong> <em>print</em> &quot;Hello&quot;; <em>print</em> &quot; 
  again&quot; <strong>end</strong></p>
<p>A block can consist of several expressions separated by semicolons or just 
  one. While <strong>begin</strong> and <strong>end</strong> or round brackets 
  can be used in either case, it is usual to use <strong>begin</strong> and <strong>end</strong> 
  to group several expressions together, and round brackets to group parts of 
  an expression which are to be evaluated first. The value returned by the block 
  is the value of the last expression. All the other expressions must return values 
  with type <em>void</em>. Empty blocks are allowed and these return <em>void</em>.</p>
<p>Declarations may appear in the block as well as expressions. The identifier 
  is then available in any of the other expressions after its declaration.
<p><strong>begin</strong> <strong>let</strong> <em>x</em> == 2; <em>x</em> + 3 
  <strong>end</strong>
<p>This block returns the value 5. <em>x</em> is not available outside the block, 
  but it is available in inner blocks.
<p><strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>p</em> == <em>print</em>;<br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>ten</em> == 10;<br>
  <em>p</em> <em>ten</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong>
<p>An identifier declared in a block "hides" an identifier with the same name 
  in a outer block.

<h4>3.5.1. Conditionals</h4>
<p>An expression can return different results according to the value of a test.</p>
<p><strong>if</strong> 3 &gt; 4 <strong>then</strong> 1 <strong>else</strong> 
  2; </p>
<p>The result of the conditional is the expression following <strong>then</strong> 
  if the condition is <em>true</em> and the expression after <strong>else</strong> 
  if the expression is <em>false</em>. In this case the result will be 2, since 
  the condition is clearly false. The expression to be tested must have type <em>boolean</em> 
  which contains the two values <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>. The two expressions 
  returned by the then- and else-parts must be the same. The else-part may be 
  omitted if the then-part returns a <em>void</em> result. </p>
<p><strong>if</strong> <em>x</em> &gt; 3 <strong>then</strong> <em>print</em> 
  &quot;yes&quot;</p>
<p>Conditionals may return procedures or types but the then- and else-parts must 
  both return values with compatible signatures.</p>
<p><strong>if</strong> ... <strong>then</strong> <em>integer</em>$<em>pred</em> 
  <strong>else</strong> <em>integer</em>$<em>succ</em></p>
<p>The expression returns a procedure which takes an integer parameter and returns 
  an integer result.</p>

<p><strong>while</strong> @<em>x</em> &gt; 0 <strong>do</strong> <em>x</em> := 
  <em>pred</em>(@<em>x</em>) </p>
<p>decrements <em>x</em> until it is zero, by repeating the second expression 
  until the first returns <em>false</em>. The expression after the <strong>while</strong> 
  must have type <em>boolean</em> and the expression after <strong>do</strong> 
  must have type <em>void</em>. The result of a "while-loop" has type <em>void</em>.</p>
<p>The "while-expression" is sometimes convenient, but it is usually both clearer 
  and more efficient to use a recursive procedure. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Procedures</h2>

<p>A procedure is an encapsulated piece of program which may take some
  parameters and returns a result.</p>
  
<h3>4.1. The Procedure Constructor</h3>

<p>A procedure is made by the <strong>procedure constructor</strong>, called a 
  lambda expression in some languages, which is a expression preceded by a <strong>procedure 
  header</strong>. The procedure header gives the names and signatures of the 
  parameters as they will be used in the expression and the signature of the result. 
</p>
<p><strong>proc</strong>(<em>i</em>: <em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em> . <em>i</em> 
  + 1</p>
<p>This is a procedure which takes a parameter called <em>i</em> in the block, 
  which is a value of type integer and it returns a result which is a value of 
  type integer. The expression returns a result which is one more than the parameter. 
  This expression is evaluated when the procedure is called and so it is equivalent 
  to the successor function for integer.</p>
<p>The procedure constructor is an expression which returns a procedure as its 
  result. It can be used directly in an expression, but usually it is bound to 
  an identifier. 
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>imax</em> == <strong>proc</strong>(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em> . <strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> &gt; <em>j</em> 
  <strong>then</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>else</strong> <em>j</em> 
<p>The identifier is then used in an expression 
<p><em>imax</em>(<em>1</em>, imax(2, 3))</p>
<h3>4.2. Recursive Procedures</h3>
<p>Recursive procedures are declared using <strong>letrec</strong>. 
<p><strong>letrec</strong> <em>fact</em> ==<strong> proc</strong>(<em>i</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em> . <strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> = 1 <strong>then</strong> 
  1 <strong>else</strong> <em>fact</em>(<em>i</em>-1) * <em>i</em>
<p>This has made the usual recursive definition of the factorial function. Recursive 
  procedures are the preferred way of making loops and repeating expressions in 
  Poly.</p> 
<h3>4.3. Operators</h3>
<p>Procedures can be declared so that they can be used as infix operators. Infix 
  operators have a <strong>precedence</strong> which determines how tightly they 
  bind. For example, the expression 
<p>1* 2+3* 4
<p>would return 20 if it were evaluated strictly from left to right, but yields 
  14 if it is evaluated using the normal algebraic rules. In this case the multiplication 
  operator <em>* </em> is said to have a higher precedence than the addition operator 
  <em>+</em>. In Poly the precedence of an infix operator is given as a number 
  between 0 and 9, the higher the number the greater the precedence. 
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>rem</em> ==<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 7 (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>: <em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em> 
  . <em>i</em> - <em>i</em> <em>div</em> <em>j</em> * <em>j</em>
<p>This declares <em>rem</em> to return the remainder after dividing <em>i</em> 
  by <em>j</em>. 
<p>73 <em>rem</em> 4
<p>In this case <em>rem</em> has been given a precedence of 7, which is the same 
  as the multiplication and division operators. The precedence of the other operators 
  is given in the description of the standard definitions. Operators with the 
  same precedence declared with <em>infix</em> associate to the left. Operators 
  can be made right associative by using <em>infixr</em>. </p>
<h3>4.4. Polymorphic Procedures</h3>
<p>The <em>imax</em> procedure declared above takes integer values and returns 
  the larger of the two, which is of course also an integer. A similar procedure 
  can be written to return the greater of two strings (in alphabetical order). 
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>smax</em> == <strong>proc</strong>(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>: 
  <em>string</em>)<em>string</em> . <strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> &gt; <em>j</em> 
  <strong>then</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>else</strong> <em>j</em>
<p><em>smax</em> is exactly the same as <em>imax</em> except for the change in 
  the names of the types. A similar procedure could be written for any type, provided 
  of course that values of the type can be compared with a <em>&gt;</em> operator. 
  In Poly a single procedure can be written to handle all these cases, such a 
  procedure is called <strong>polymorphic</strong>. 
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>pmax</em> == <strong>proc</strong>(<em>a_type</em>: 
  <strong>type</strong>(<em>t</em>) &gt; : <strong>proc</strong>(<em>t</em>;<em>t</em>)<em>boolean</em> 
  <strong>end</strong>; <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>: <em>a_type</em>)<em>a_type</em> 
  .<strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> &gt; <em>j</em> <strong>then</strong> <em>i</em> 
  <strong>else</strong> <em>j</em> 
<p>It works by requiring an extra parameter, <em>a_type</em>, which is the type 
  of the values (recall that types can be passed as parameters to procedures). 
  The important thing about this type is that it must have a <em>&gt;</em> operator 
  which compares two values of the type and returns a boolean value. The type 
  signature
<p><strong>type</strong>(<em>t</em>) &gt; : <strong>proc</strong>(<em>t</em>; 
  <em>t</em>)<em>boolean</em> <strong>end</strong>
<p>expresses this constraint. The other two parameters and the result must be 
  of this type. <em>pmax</em> can therefore be applied to any type which satisfies 
  the constraint, and a pair of values of the type.
<p><em>pmax</em>(<em>integer</em>, 1, 2)
<p>returns an integer result, while 
<p><em>pmax</em>(<em>string</em>, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abd&quot;)
<p>will return a string. However 
<p><em>pmax</em>(<em>integer</em>, 1, &quot;abc&quot;)<br>
  <em>pmax</em>(<em>string</em>, 3, 4)
<p>will be rejected by the compiler because the signatures do not match. 
<p>max(boolean, true, false)
<p>will also fail, because <em>boolean</em> does not possess a <em>&gt;</em> operator. </p>
<h3>4.5. Implied Parameters</h3>
<p>It is not very convenient to have to write an extra parameter when calling 
  polymorphic procedures, especially since it is just the type of the other parameters. 
  Poly allows a polymorphic procedure to be written so that the type parameters 
  need not be given explicitly but are passed implicitly. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>max</em> ==<br>
  <strong>proc</strong><strong>[</strong><em>a_type</em>: <strong>type</strong> 
  (<em>t</em>) &gt; : <strong>proc</strong>(<em>t</em>;<em>t</em>)<em>boolean</em> 
  <strong>end</strong><strong>]</strong>(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>: <em>a_type</em>)<em>a_type</em> 
  . <strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> &gt; <em>j</em> <strong>then</strong> <em>i</em> 
  <strong>else</strong> <em>j</em><br>
</p>
<p>The type parameter in this case is enclosed in square brackets to indicate 
  that there will not be a corresponding actual parameter. </p>
<p><em>max</em>(3,4)</p>
<p>looks at the actual parameters, finds that they are integers and so passes 
  the type <em>integer</em> implicitly.</p>
<p><em>max</em>(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;bcd&quot;)</p>
<p>passes the type <em>string</em>.</p>
<p><em>max</em>(3, &quot;abc&quot;)</p>
<p>is incorrect because the parameters must have the same type.</p>
<p>Implied parameters are a very powerful facility. All the operators such as 
  <em>+</em> and <em>&gt;</em> are polymorphic procedures which take the type 
  of their explicit parameters as an implied parameter. Their only action is to 
  select and apply the appropriate procedure from the type (This does not mean 
  that adding two integers together requires two procedure calls. These operations 
  are implemented as inline procedures and the compiler optimises it down to a 
  single "add" instruction.) For example, the definition of <em>+</em> in the 
  standard header is </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> + { addition } == <strong>proc</strong> <strong>early</strong> 
  <strong>inline</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 6 <strong>[</strong><em>inttype</em> 
  : <strong>type</strong> (<em>t</em>) + : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>t</em>; 
  <em>t</em>)<em>t</em> <strong>end</strong><strong>]</strong> (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> 
  : <em>inttype</em>) <em>inttype</em>} . <em>x</em> <em>inttype</em>$+ <em>y</em></p>
<p>The words <strong>early</strong> and <strong>inline</strong> are directives 
  to the compiler. <strong>early</strong> tells the compiler that this procedure 
  should be evaluated as soon as possible. This usually means that the compiler 
  will attempt to execute it when it is compiled if its parameters are constants 
  (Since procedures can have side-effects the compiler must not attempt to evaluate 
  all procedures at compile-time. Consider, for example, a procedure which returns 
  the current date and time). <strong>inline</strong> tells the compiler to insert 
  the code for this procedure at the point of call rather than generate a procedure 
  call. Both <strong>early</strong> and <strong>inline</strong> are hints to the 
  compiler rather than instructions, and the compiler may choose to ignore either 
  or both. \syntax{&lt;procedure signature&gt; . &lt;expression&gt;} { &lt;procedure 
  constructor&gt; ::=&lt;procedure signature&gt; . &lt;expression&gt; } </p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Chapter 5. Exceptions</h2>
<p>Normally expressions in a block are executed one after another until the end 
  of the block is reached. There are occasions, however, when an unusual case 
  occurs and an escape is needed. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>p</em> == <em>q</em> <em>div</em> <em>r</em></p>
<p>For example, a program containing a divide operation could possibly fail if 
  <em>r</em> were zero. Explicitly checking for zero before making the division 
  would be tedious and unnecessary in most cases, so what happens is that an <strong>exception</strong> 
  is generated. Exceptions are error conditions together with a string which identifies 
  the cause of the failure. Dividing by zero, for example, results in an exception 
  with the string <em>divideerror</em>. An exception can also be generated by 
  using <strong>raise</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>raise</strong> <em>an_error</em> </p>
<p>generates an exception with the name <em>an_error</em>.</p>
<p>Exceptions generated in a block may be caught by a <strong>handler</strong>. 
  A handler is given control when any exception in the block happens and either 
  returns a result or raises another exception. The handler is a procedure whose 
  parameter is a string, the exception name, and result must be compatible with 
  the result the block would return if the exception had not happened.</p>
<p><strong>begin</strong><br>
  <em>i</em> <em>div</em> <em>j</em><br>
  <strong>catch</strong> <strong>proc</strong> (<em>name</em>: <em>string</em>)<em>integer</em><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <em>print</em>(&quot;Exception-&quot;);<br>
  <em>print</em>(<em>name</em>);<br>
  9999<br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p>This block returns the result of dividing <em>i</em> by <em>j</em> unless an 
  exception occurs. In that case it prints out <em>Exception-</em> followed by 
  the name of the exception, and returns the (large) value 9999.</p>
<p>The handling procedure can be any which has the correct signature, but frequently 
  it is written as a procedure constructor after the word <strong>catch</strong> 
  . Any exceptions raised by the handler are, of course, not caught by it, but 
  appear in the next block out. In addition, if the block contains declarations 
  they are not available to the handler. This is because an exception could occur 
  while the declarations were being made so the identifier would have no value.</p>
<p><strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>val</em> == <em>i</em> <em>div</em> <em>j</em>;<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>otherval</em> == <em>i</em>+1;<br>
  <strong>catch</strong> <strong>proc</strong> (<em>name</em>: <em>string</em>)...<br>
  <strong>begin</strong> { Cannot use val or otherval here }<br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p>If an exception is not caught in a block it automatically propagates to the 
  containing block. This in turn can handle it, or allow it to propagate to the 
  next block out. An exception raised in a procedure but not caught in it causes 
  the procedure to return and the exception appears at the point where the procedure 
  was called. The calling block will catch the exception if it has a handler or 
  it will propagate back further.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Specialised Type Constructors</h2>
<p>There are three specialised constructors which make different kinds of types. 
  They are normally used to provide the &quot;concrete&quot; type which implements 
  an abstract type. The development of abstract types will be described in the 
  next chapter.</p>
<h3>6.1. Records</h3>
<p>A <strong>record type</strong> allows objects composed of a group of values 
  to be put together and taken apart.</p>
<p> <strong>let</strong> <em>int_pair</em> == <strong>record</strong> (<em>first</em>, 
  <em>second</em>: <em>integer</em>) } makes a type with the operations for making 
  pairs of integers. The names <em>first</em> and <em>second</em> are known as 
  <strong>field names</strong> and the signature, in this case <em>integer</em> 
  is the <strong>field signature</strong>. The result of this declaration is a 
  type <em>int_pair</em> has three operations in it, <em>constr</em>, <em>first</em> 
  and <em>second</em>. </p>
<p>Every record has a <em>constr</em> procedure which takes objects with the field 
  signatures and makes them into a record value. The <em>constr</em> in <em>int_pair</em> 
  takes two integer values and packages them up as a value of the <em>int_pair</em> 
  type. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>pair_val</em> == <em>int_pair</em>$<em>constr</em>(1, 
  2); </p>
<p>The field names <em>first</em> and <em>second</em> are procedures called <strong>selectors</strong> 
  that take apart values of the <em>int_pair</em> type and return the first and 
  second values respectively. </p>
<p><em>int_pair</em>$<em>first</em>(<em>pair_val</em>)</p>
<p>will return 1 and</p>
<p><em>int_pair</em>$<em>second</em>(<em>pair_val</em>)</p>
<p>will return 2. Records can be made with elements of any signature and any number 
  of elements.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>prec</em> == <strong>record</strong> (<em>val</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>; <em>pr</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em>); 
</p>
<p>makes a record to hold a value and a procedure. A value of this type can be 
  made by </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>prec_val</em> == <em>prec</em>$<em>constr</em>(1, 
  <em>integer</em>$<em>succ</em>)</p>
<p>and the selecting functions <em>val</em> and <em>pr</em> now return an integer 
  value and a procedure respectively.</p>
<p><em>prec</em>$<em>pr</em>(<em>prec_val</em>)(99) + <em>prec</em>$<em>val</em>(<em>prec_val</em>)</p>
<p>Note, however that each invocation of the record constructor, as with the other 
  constructors, yields a type with a new unique type mark. This means that two 
  record types with identical field names and signatures are regarded as different 
  types. A more convenient syntax for selection is available which allows</p>
<p><em>pair_val</em>.<em>first</em> <em>pair_val</em>.<em>second</em></p>
<p> to be used with exactly the same meaning as </p>
<p><em>int_pair</em>$<em>first</em>(<em>pair_val</em>) <em>int_pair</em>$<em>second</em>(<em>pair_val</em>)</p>
<p>This syntax is not restricted to record selection but can be used with any 
  procedure that is an object in a type and takes one argument of that type. The 
  meaning of <em>X.Y</em> is</p>
<p><em>X_type</em>$<em>Y</em>(<em>X</em>)</p>
<p>where <em>X_type</em> is the type to which <em>X</em> belongs. So for example, 
</p>
<p>99.<em>succ</em>.<em>print</em></p>
<p> is equivalent to </p>
<p><em>integer</em>$<em>print</em>(<em>integer</em>$<em>succ</em>(99))</p>

<h3> 6.2. Unions</h3>
<p>The record constructor makes types whose values are groups of objects. Another 
  constructor, the <strong>union</strong> constructor, makes types whose values 
  may have any of a set of signatures.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>int_or_str</em> == <strong>union</strong> (<em>int</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>; <em>str</em>: <em>string</em>)</p>
<p>This has created a type whose values can be either integers or strings. The 
  names before the colons (<em>int</em> and <em>str</em>) are called <strong>tags</strong> 
  and a tag and its signature (after the colon) is called a <strong>variant</strong>. 
  An integer or string may be converted into this type by <strong>injection</strong> 
  operations. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>int_form</em> == <em>int_or_str</em>$<em>inj_int</em>(99)<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>str_form</em> == <em>int_or_str</em>$<em>inj_str</em>("hello")</p>
<p>The names of the injection operations are made by prepending the word <em>inj_</em> 
  to the tags. The original string and integer values can be obtained by <strong>projecting</strong> 
  the union value.</p>
<p><em>int_or_str</em>$<em>proj_int</em>(<em>int_form</em>)<br>
  <em>int_or_str</em>$<em>proj_str</em>(<em>str_form</em>)</p>
<p>The names of these operations are made in a similar way to the injection operations 
  and return a value with the appropriate signature. Of course it is possible 
  to apply the wrong projection. </p>
<p><em>int_or_str</em>$<em>proj_str</em>(<em>int_form</em>)</p>
<p>Since <em>int_form</em> contains an integer it cannot be made to return a string, 
  and so this operation will cause an exception with the name <em>projecterror</em>. 
  To avoid getting exceptions, the union value can be tested to see if it is a 
  particular variant. </p>
<p><strong>if</strong> <em>int_or_str</em>$<em>is_str</em>(<em>int_form</em>) 
  <strong>then</strong> ... </p>
<p>will not execute the expression after <strong>then</strong> because the test 
  will return false. However</p>
<p><em>int_or_str</em>$<em>is_int</em>(<em>int_form</em>)</p>
<p>will return true. The alternative syntax for fields of records can be used 
  when projecting or testing unions.</p>
<p><em>int_form</em>.<em>proj_int</em><em><br>
  str_form</em>.<em>proj_str</em><em><br>
  int_form</em>.<em>is_int</em></p>
<p>As with records the variants may be procedures or types as well as values and 
  it is possible to have two variants with the same signature.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>a_union</em> == <strong>union</strong> (<em>one</em>, 
  <em>another</em>: <em>integer</em>; <em>p</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em>)</p>
<p>The two variants <em>one</em> and <em>another</em> are different, so</p>
<p><em>a_union</em>$<em>proj_one</em>(<em>a_union</em>$<em>inj_another</em>(99))</p>
<p>will result in an exception. </p>

<h3>6.3. Structures</h3>
<p> The third built-in type constructor makes <strong>structure</strong> types. 
  Structures are very similar to records in that their values are composed of 
  groups of objects. The difference is that there is an additional value <em>nil</em> 
  in the type and there are operations to compare structure values. Structures 
  are mostly used in recursive declarations to create lists and trees. In fact 
  most structures can be represented using record and union constructors but they 
  are useful enough to be provided separately. </p>
<p><strong>letrec</strong> <em>int_list</em> == <strong>struct</strong> (<em>hd</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>; <em>tl</em>: <em>int_list</em>)</p>
<p>This has created a type which can construct lists of integers. It has five 
  operations together with the the <em>nil</em> value. <em>constr</em> can be 
  used to make <em>int_list</em> values. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>a_list</em> == <em>int_list</em>$<em>constr</em>(1, 
  <em>int_list</em>$<em>constr</em>(2, <em>int_list</em>$<em>nil</em>))</p>
<p>The <em>nil</em> value is used to end the list. Without it there would be no 
  way to construct a structure since a value of the type is needed before a node 
  can be made. The selector procedures, <em>hd</em> and <em>tl</em> are used to 
  select the parts of the structure in the same way as for a record.</p>
<p><em>int_list</em>$<em>hd</em>(<em>a_list</em>) <em>int_list</em>$<em>hd</em>(<em>int_list</em>$<em>tl</em>(<em>a_list</em>))</p>
<p>If a selector is applied to nil an exception <em>nilreference</em> is raised, 
  since there is no value that can be returned. There are two operations = and 
  <em>&lt;&gt;</em> which compare two structure values. = only returns <em>true</em> 
  if they the structures are <strong>identical</strong>, that is they were made 
  with the same call of <em>constr</em> or they are both <em>nil</em>. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>b_list</em> == <em>int_list</em>$<em>constr</em>(2, 
  <em>int_list</em>$<em>nil</em>)</p>
<p>has made a list with the same <em>hd</em> and <em>tl</em> values as the tail 
  of <em>a_list</em> but</p>
<p><em>b_list</em> = <em>a_list</em>.<em>tl</em></p>
<p>will return <em>false</em>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Type Constructor</h2>
<p>As well as the using the constructors described above it is possible to make 
  a type by extending an existing one. This usually involves adding new procedures 
  or replacing existing ones. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>new_int</em> ==<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>int</em>) <strong>extends</strong> <em>integer</em>;<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>sqr</em> == <strong>proc</strong> (<em>i</em>: <em>int</em>)<em>int</em> 
  . <em>i</em>*<em>i</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p> This declares <em>new_int</em> to be a type which is an <strong>extension</strong> 
  of the existing type <em>integer</em>. The name in brackets, <em>int</em>, is 
  used inside the constructor to represent the type being made. For instance the 
  parameter and result of <em>sqr</em> both have type <em>int</em>. The result 
  of this constructor is a type which has all the operations which <em>integer</em> 
  had, but in addition it has a <em>sqr</em> procedure which returns the square 
  of its parameter. This new type is different from <em>integer</em> so it cannot 
  be used directly on values with the integer type. The conversion operation <em>up</em> 
  must be used to make an <em>integer</em> value into a <em>new_int</em> one. 
</p>
<p><em>new_int</em>$<em>sqr</em>(<em>new_int</em>$<em>up</em>(99))</p>
<p>There is a similar operation <em>down</em> which will convert values in the 
  opposite direction </p>
<p>10 + <em>new_int</em>$<em>down</em>(<em>new_int</em>$<em>sqr</em>(<em>new_int</em>$<em>up</em>(11)))</p>
<p>These two operations are added to the new type when an old type is being extended 
  to allow conversion of values from the old to the new types. They can be redefined 
  if necessary or, as we shall see, "hidden" so that conversion of values is not 
  possible.</p>
<p>The above example shows how a new type can be made which is slightly
  different from an existing one.</p>
  
<h3>7.1. A New Type</h3>

<p>The same approach is used to construct a completely new type. We have already 
  seen that a record can be used to make a pair of integers and this pair can 
  be extended to make a double precision integer type. Suppose that the maximum 
  range of numbers which could be held in a single integer was from -9999 to 9999. 
  Then a double-precision number could be defined by representing it as a record 
  with two fields, a high and low order part, and the actual number would have 
  value (high)*10000 + (low). This can be implemented as follows.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>dp</em> ==<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>d</em>) <strong>extends</strong> <strong>record</strong> 
  (<em>hi</em>, <em>lo</em>: <em>integer</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>succ</em> ==<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> (<em>x</em>:<em>d</em>)<em>d</em><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>if</strong> <em>x</em>.<em>lo</em> = 9999<br>
  <strong>then</strong> <em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(<em>succ</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>hi</em>), 
  0)<br>
  <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> <em>x</em>.<em>hi</em> &lt; 0&amp; 
  <em>x</em>.<em>lo</em> = 0<br>
  <strong>then</strong> <em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(<em>succ</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>hi</em>), 
  ~9999)<br>
  <strong>else</strong> <em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>hi</em>, <em>succ</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>lo</em>))<br>
  <strong>end</strong>;<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>pred</em> ==<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> (<em>x</em>:<em>d</em>)<em>d</em><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>if</strong> <em>x</em>.<em>lo</em> = ~9999<br>
  <strong>then</strong> <em>d</em>$ <em>constr</em>(<em>pred</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>hi</em>), 
  0)<br>
  <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> <em>x</em>.<em>hi</em> &gt; 0 &amp; 
  <em>x</em>.<em>lo</em> = 0<br>
  <strong>then</strong> <em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(<em>pred</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>hi</em>), 
  9999)<br>
  <strong>else</strong> <em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>hi</em>, <em>pred</em>(<em>x</em>.<em>lo</em>))<br>
  <strong>end</strong>;<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>zero</em> == <em>d</em>$ <em>constr</em>(0,0);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>iszero</em> == <strong>proc</strong> (<em>x</em>:<em>d</em>) 
  <em>boolean</em> . <em>x</em>.<em>hi</em> = 0 &amp; <em>x</em>.<em>lo</em> = 
  0<br>
  <strong>end</strong>; </p>
<p>This is sufficient to provide the basis of all the arithmetic operations, since 
  +, -, * etc. can all be defined in terms of <em>succ</em>, <em>pred</em>, <em>zero</em> 
  and <em>iszero</em>. Of course they can be included in the type if required.</p>
  
<h3>7.2. Information Hiding</h3>

<p>As it stands this type includes the operations <em>hi</em>, <em>lo</em> and 
  <em>constr</em> which were inherited from the record type as well as the new 
  operations. These old operations are a nuisance, they are not part of the double-precision 
  type as such and they provide a security risk since it would be possible for 
  someone to produce a value which appeared to be a double-precision number but, 
  for example, had a positive high order part and a negative low order part. Unwanted 
  operations can be masked out by giving an explicit signature which contains 
  only those operations which are actually required. 
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>dble</em>:<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>d</em>)<br>
  <em>succ</em>, <em>pred</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>d</em>)<em>d</em>;<br>
  <em>zero</em>: <em>d</em>;<br>
  <em>iszero</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>d</em>)<em>boolean</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  == <em>dp</em>;
<p>This has created a new type <em>dble</em> which takes objects from <em>dp</em> 
  but only takes those which are explicitly given in the type signature. It is 
  impossible to create a value of the <em>dble</em> type or take it apart except 
  with the given operations. An alternative would have been to have given the 
  explicit signature in the original declaration. 
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>dp</em>:<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>d</em>)<br>
  <em>succ</em>, <em>pred</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>d</em>)<em>d</em>;<br>
  <em>zero</em>: <em>d</em>;<br>
  <em>iszero</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>d</em>)<em>boolean</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  ==<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>d</em>) <strong>extends</strong> ... { The body of 
  <em>dp</em> as before. }<br>
  <strong>end</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7.3. Conversions</h3>
<p>This double-precision type suffers from the problem that the only constant 
  value is <em>zero</em>. All other values have to be made by using <em>succ</em> 
  or <em>pred</em>. It would be convenient if other constants could be made. One 
  way would be to define a procedure inside the type constructor which would convert 
  an <em>integer</em> value into a <em>dble</em> one.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>make_double</em> ==<strong> proc</strong> (<em>int</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>)<em>d</em>. <em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(0, <em>int</em>)</p>
<p>This assumes that no <em>integer</em> value is greater than 10000. If larger 
  <em>integer</em> values are possible then the body of the procedure would be 
</p>
<p><em>d</em>$<em>constr</em>(<em>int</em> <em>div</em> 10000, <em>int</em> <em>mod</em> 
  10000)</p>
<p><em>integer</em> values can now be made into <em>dble</em> ones.</p>
<p><em>dble</em>$<em>make_double</em>(42)</p>
<p>The maximum value is limited by the maximum possible <em>integer</em>, so very 
  large double-precision numbers still cannot be made. It would be nice to be 
  able to have large literal constants such as 12345678 in a program. A solution 
  to this is to convert literals directly from their string representations i.e. 
  from the string "12345678". This is done by defining a conversion procedure 
  with the name <em>convertn</em> inside the type. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>convertn</em> ==<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> (<em>rep</em>: <em>string</em>)<em>d</em><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>letrec</strong> <em>getch</em> ==<br>
  { Returns the result of converting the first <em>i</em> characters. }<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> (<em>i</em>: <em>integer</em>)<em>d</em><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> = 0<br>
  <strong>then</strong> <em>zero</em><br>
  <strong>else</strong><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>this_ch</em> == <em>rep</em> <em>sub</em> <em>i</em>; 
  { Obtains the ith. character }<br>
  <strong>if</strong> <em>this_ch</em> &lt; '0' | <em>this_ch</em> &gt; '9' { 
  Must be a digit }<br>
  <strong>then</strong> <strong>raise</strong> <em>conversionerror</em><br>
  <strong>else</strong><br>
  {Convert the first i-1 characters}<br>
  {then multiply by 10 and add in this digit}<br>
  <em>getch</em>(<em>i</em>-1)* <em>d</em>$ <em>make_value</em>(10) +<em> d</em>$ 
  <em>make_value</em>(<em>ord</em>(<em>this_ch</em>) - <em>ord</em>('0'))<br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong>;<br>
  <em>getch</em>(<em>string</em>$ <em>length</em>(<em>rep</em>))<br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p>This procedure reads the string and converts it into the numeric value. If 
  any of the characters is not a digit then it raises the exception <em>conversionerror</em>. 
  We assume that + and <em>*</em> operations have been defined for the type.</p>
<p>With this operation it is possible to write expressions like</p>
<p><em>dble</em>$12345678 + <em>dble</em>$99999</p>
<p>The compiler automatically generates a call to <em>dble$convertn</em> when 
  it recognises these constants. It is usual to declare conversion routines as 
  <strong>early</strong> so that the compiler will do the conversion, rather than 
  leaving the conversion until the program is run. If a number is not preceeded 
  by a type name then the conversion used is the value of <em>convertn</em> which 
  is in scope. The standard header contains the binding</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>convertn</em> == <em>integer</em>$ <em>convertn</em></p>
<p>so that numerical constants are converted to <em>integer</em> by default.</p>
<p>There are two other conversion operations, <em>convertc</em> for strings in 
  single quotes, and <em>converts</em> for strings in double quotes. These default 
  to <em>char$convertc</em> and <em>string$converts</em> respectively. </p>
<h3>7.4. Generic Types</h3>

<p>Types in Poly can be treated as ordinary values. We have already seen how the
  ability to pass types as parameters to a procedure allows polymorphic
  operations, we shall now see how being able to return a type can be useful.</p>
<p>A type which could be used to hold lists of <em>integer</em> values was described 
  above. It was defined as</p>
<p><strong>letrec</strong> <em>int_list</em> == <strong>struct</strong> (<em>hd</em>: 
  <em>integer</em>; <em>tl</em>: <em>int_list</em>)</p>
<p>A type for lists of strings would be almost identical.</p>
<p><strong>letrec</strong> <em>str_list</em> == <strong>struct</strong> (<em>hd</em>: 
  <em>string</em>; <em>tl</em>: <em>str_list</em>)</p>
<p> Indeed lists of any type could be defined in the same way. The signature of 
  the type in each case is basically the same.</p>
<p><strong>type</strong> (<em>list</em>)<br>
  <em>hd</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>list</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  <em>tl</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>list</em>)<em>list</em>;<br>
  <em>constr</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>; <em>list</em>)<em>list</em>;<br>
  <em>nil</em>: <em>list</em>;<br>
  &lt;&gt;, = : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>list</em>; <em>list</em>)<em>boolean</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong> </p>
<p>We can define a list type for an arbitrary element type using a procedure.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>list</em> ==<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> (<em>element_type</em>: <strong>type</strong> <strong>end</strong>)<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>list</em>)<br>
  <em>hd</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>list</em>)<em>element_type</em>;<br>
  <em>tl</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>list</em>)<em>list</em>;<br>
  <em>constr</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>element_type</em>; <em>list</em>)<em>list</em>;<br>
  <em>nil</em>: <em>list</em>;<br>
  &lt;&gt;, = : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>list</em>; <em>list</em>)<em>boolean</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong> .<br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>letrec</strong> <em>list_type</em> == <strong>struct</strong> (<em>hd</em>: 
  <em>element_type</em>; <em>tl</em>: <em>list_type</em>);<br>
  <em>list_type</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p>This procedure can be applied to any type, since any type matches the empty 
  type "<strong>type</strong> <strong>end</strong>". </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>int_list</em> == <em>list</em>(<em>integer</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>str_list</em> == <em>list</em>(string);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>dble_list</em> == <em>list</em>(<em>dble</em>);</p>
<p>The result is always a list with the same operations, but different signatures.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>a_list</em> == <em>int_list</em>$ <em>constr</em>(999, 
  <em>int_list</em>$ <em>nil</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>b_list</em> == <em>str_list</em>$ <em>constr</em>(&quot;hello&quot;, 
  <em>str_list</em>$ <em>nil</em>); </p>
<p>The list types are different types, so only operations of the correct type 
  are possible.</p>
<p><em>int_list</em>$ <em>hd</em>(<em>a_list</em>);<br>
  <em>str_list</em>$ <em>hd</em>(<em>b_list</em>) </p>
<p>are valid, but </p>
<p><em>int_list</em>$ <em>hd</em>(<em>b_list</em>);<br>
  <em>int_list</em>$ <em>tl</em>(<em>b_list</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>c_list</em> == <em>int_list</em>$ <em>constr</em>(999, 
  <em>b_list</em>)</p>
<p>are not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Standard Definitions</h2>
<p>Poly is extremely flexible because much of the system is built
  on top of the language rather than built into it.
  It can be changed as required by redefining or adding new definitions.
  The standard definitions contain types and procedures which are likely
  to be of use to many programmers.
  For efficiency reasons some are written in assembly code or are handled
  specially by the code generator, but they all have signatures like
  ordinary definitions and can be redefined if required.</p>
  
<h3>8.1. Primitive Types</h3>
  
<h4>8.1.1. void</h4>

<p><em>void</em> is used as a form of place-holder when a type is expected. For 
  example, procedures which have side effects but no result are considered as 
  returning a value of type <em>void</em>. It has only one value <em>empty</em>, 
  and its signature is simply  </p>
<p><em>void</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>void</em>)<br>
  <em>empty</em> : <em>void</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong> </p>
<h4>8.1.2. boolean</h4>

<p><em>Boolean</em> is the type used in tests. It has two values <em>true</em> 
  and <em>false</em>. The complete signature is
<p><em>boolean</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>boolean</em>)<br>
  <em>true</em>, <em>false</em> : <em>boolean</em>;<br>
  &amp; : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 4(<em>boolean</em>; <em>boolean</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  | : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 3(<em>boolean</em>; <em>boolean</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  ~ : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>boolean</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  &lt;&gt;, = : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 5(<em>boolean</em>; 
  <em>boolean</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>repr</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>boolean</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  <em>print</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>boolean</em>)<br>
  <strong>end</strong>
<p>The <strong>&amp;</strong>, <em><strong>|</strong></em> and <em><strong>~</strong></em> 
  operations correspond to the normal <em>boolean</em> operations <strong>AND</strong> 
  (the result is <em>true</em> only if both the arguments are <em>true</em>), 
  <strong>OR</strong> (the result is <em>true</em> if either arguments are <em>true</em>) 
  and <strong>NOT</strong> (the result is <em>true</em> if the argument is <em>false</em> 
  and vice-versa). <em>&lt;&gt;</em> and <em>=</em> compare the two arguments 
  and can be regarded as exclusive-OR and exclusive-NOR respectively. <em>repr</em> 
  returns the string "true" if the argument is <em>true</em> and "false" if it 
  is <em>false</em>. <em>print</em> prints the string representation on the terminal. </p>
<h4>8.1.3. integer</h4>
<p>The type <em>integer</em> is the basic type used for numbers. Its signature 
  is </p>
<p><em>integer</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<br>
  <em>first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>zero</em> : <em>integer</em>;<br>
  +, - : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 6(<em>integer</em>; <em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  <em>* </em>, <em>div</em>, <em>mod</em> : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 
  7(<em>integer</em>; <em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  <em>pred</em>, <em>succ</em>, <em>neg</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  ~ : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  &lt;, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, =, &gt;, &gt;= : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 
  5(<em>integer</em>; <em>integer</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>convertn</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  <em>repr</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  <em>print</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>);<br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p><em>first</em> and <em>last</em> are the minimum and maximum values that an 
  <em>integer</em> can have. <em>last</em> is frequently one less than the negative 
  of <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>+ and <em>-</em> are the usual infix addition and subtraction operations. They 
  raise the exception <em>range</em> if the result is outside the valid range.</p>
<p><em>* </em> is the infix multiplication operator which also raises
  <em>range</em> is the result is out of range.</p>
<p><em>div</em> is the division operator and <em>mod</em> returns the remainder.
  They both generate <em>divide</em> if they are asked to divide by zero, and
  <em>div</em> may generate <em>range</em> when
  <em>first</em>
  is divided by minus
  one.</p>
<p><em>pred</em> and <em>succ</em> respectively subtract and add one to a number,
  raising <em>range</em> if the result is out of range.</p>
<p><em>neg</em> returns the negative, raising
  <em>range</em> if its argument is
  <em>first</em>.</p>
<p><em>~</em> is the same as <em>neg</em>.</p>
<p><em>&lt;</em>, <em>&lt;=</em>, <em>&lt;&gt;</em>, <em>=</em>, <em>&gt;</em> 
  and <em>&gt;=</em> are the
  usual infix comparison operations.</p>
<p><em>convertn</em> is the operation which converts literal constants into integers. 
  It recognises strings of digits as decimal (base 10) values unless the first 
  character is a '0' in which case it treats it as an octal value or hexadecimal 
  if it starts with '0x'. <em>conversion</em> is raised if the string does not 
  fit one of these forms or <em>rangeerror</em> if it is too large.</p>
<p><em>repr</em> performs the reverse of <em>convertn</em> by generating a string
  from a number.
  It is always generated as a decimal number.</p>
<p><em>print</em> prints the string representation on the terminal.</p>
<h4>8.1.4. long_integer</h4>
<p><em>long_integer</em> is very similar to <em>integer</em> but it allows larger 
  numbers to be handled. Its signature is
<p><em>long_integer</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>long_integer</em>)<br>
  <em>first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>zero</em> : <em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  +, - : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 6(<em>long_integer</em>; 
  <em>long_integer</em>)<em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  <em>* </em>, <em>div</em>, <em>mod</em>: <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 
  7(<em>long_integer</em>; <em>long_integer</em>)<em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  <em>pred</em>, <em>succ</em>, <em>neg</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>long_integer</em>)<em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  ~ : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>long_integer</em>)<em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  &lt;, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, =, &gt;, &gt;= : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 
  5(<em>long_integer</em>; <em>long_integer</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>convertn</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  <em>repr</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>long_integer</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  <em>print</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>long_integer</em>);<br>
  <em>from_integer</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<em>long_integer</em>;<br>
  <em>to_integer</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>long_integer</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  <strong>end</strong>
<p>The signature is the same as that of integer with the addition of <em>from_integer</em> 
  and <em>to_integer</em> which convert between <em>integer</em> and <em>long_integer</em>. 
  <em>to_integer</em> generates a <em>rangeerror</em> exception if the value is 
  too large to fit into an integer. </p>
<h4>8.1.5. char</h4>
<p>The type <em>char</em> is the type of character values. It has signature
<p><em>char</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>char</em>)<br>
  <em>first</em>, <em>last</em> : <em>char</em>;<br>
  &lt;, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, =, &gt;, &gt;= : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 
  5(<em>char</em>; <em>char</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>convertc</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>char</em>;<br>
  <em>pred</em>, <em>succ</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>char</em>)<em>char</em>;<br>
  <em>repr</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>char</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  <em>print</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>char</em>);<br>
  <strong>end</strong> 
<p>Characters are regarded as being ordered according to the underlying character 
  code. The ordering will usually follow alphabetic order. <em>first</em> and 
  <em>last</em> are the smallest and largest characters and <em>pred</em> and 
  <em>succ</em> give the previous and succeeding characters according to the ordering. 
  <em>pred</em> and <em>succ</em> raise the <em>range</em> exception if a value 
  would be produced outside the range. The comparison operations compare values 
  according to the ordering. </p>
<h4>8.1.6. string</h4>
<p>Character strings have type <em>string</em>. 
<p><em>string</em> :<br>
  <strong><strong></strong>type</strong> (<em>string</em>)<br>
  <em>mk</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>char</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  &lt;, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, =, &gt;, &gt;= : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 
  5(<em>string</em>; <em>string</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>converts</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  <em>length</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>integer</em>;<br>
  <em>print</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>);<br>
  <em>repr</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  + : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 6(<em>string</em>; <em>string</em>)<em>string</em>;<br>
  <em>sub</em> : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>infix</strong> 8(<em>string</em>; 
  <em>integer</em>)<em>char</em>;<br>
  <em>substring</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>; <em>integer</em>; 
  <em>integer</em>)<em>string</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong>
<p><em>mk</em> converts a character into a single length string, while <em>sub</em> 
  selects a character at a particular position. The character positions are numbered 
  from 1 to the length of the string, returned by <em>length</em>. Selecting a 
  character outside this range results in a <em>subscript</em> exception. Subcripting 
  a zero length string will therefore always result in an exception. <em>substring</em> 
  extracts a string from another. It takes as parameters a string, an integer 
  which gives the starting position in the string, and a second integer which 
  gives the number of characters to select. 
<p><em>string</em>$<em>substring</em>(&quot;hello&quot;, 3,2); 
<p>results in the string "ll". If the first parameter is outside the string or 
  there are not enough characters in the string then <em>subscript</em> is raised. 
  Two strings can be concatenated by +. </p>
<h3>8.2. Variables and Vectors</h3>
<p>So far the language described has been purely applicative, that is
  procedures can be applied to values, but there is no way to change the
  value associated with an object.
  Variables and vectors can be created and used in Poly but they are not built
  into the type system.</p>
  
<h4>8.2.1. new</h4>
<p>Variables are created by the procedure <em>new</em> which has the following 
  signature. </p>
<p><em>new</em> : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>[</strong><em>base</em> : <strong>type</strong> 
  <strong>end</strong> <strong>]</strong> (<em>base</em>)<br>
  <strong>type</strong><br>
  <em>assign</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>base</em>);<br>
  <em>content</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>base</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p><em>new</em> is a procedure which takes a value of any type and returns a type 
  with two operations <em>assign</em> and <em>content</em> as its result. For 
  example, </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>v</em> == <em>new</em>(99); </p>
<p>declares <em>v</em> as a type with signature </p>
<p><em>v</em>: <strong>type</strong><br>
  <em>assign</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>);<br>
  <em>content</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>integer</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong> </p>
<p>The type is here being used as a way of packaging together a pair of procedures, 
  there is no such thing as a value of this type.</p>
<p>The parameter type of <em>assign</em> and the result of <em>content</em> were 
  found from the type of the original argument (99 has type <em>integer</em>). 
  The current value associated with the variable is found using the <em>content</em> 
  procedure. </p>
<p><em>v</em>$<em>content</em>()</p>
<p>will return 99, the initial value associated with it. The value can be changed 
  using <em>assign</em>. </p>
<p><em>v</em>$<em>assign</em>(<em>v</em>$<em>content</em>()+1); </p>
<p>sets the value to 100.</p>
<p>Variables can be passed as parameters and returned as results from procedures 
  like any other value. However, note that</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>vv</em> == <em>v</em>; </p>
<p>makes <em>vv</em> the same value as <em>v</em> which means that it refers to 
  the same variable, and hence changes to <em>vv</em> will affect the value returned 
  from <em>v</em> and vice versa.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to write "$<em>content</em>()" after every variable name 
  in order to extract its value, the compiler will attempt to call the <em>content</em> 
  object of a type if it is given one when it expects an ordinary value. There 
  is also an infix assignment operator defined in the standard header which allows 
  use of the normal syntax for assignment. 
<p><em>v</em> := <em>v</em>+1
<p>is therefore equivalent to
<p><em>v</em>$<em>assign</em>(<em>v</em>$<em>content</em>()+1)

<h4>8.2.2. vector</h4>
<p><em>vector</em> is a procedure which creates an array of variables. </p>
<p><em>vector</em>: <strong>proc</strong> <strong>[</strong><em>base</em> : <strong>type</strong> 
  <strong>end</strong> <strong>]</strong> (<em>size</em>: <em>integer</em>; <em>initial_value</em>: 
  <em>base</em>)<br>
  <strong>type</strong><br>
  <em>sub</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>)<br>
  <strong>type</strong><br>
  <em>assign</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>base</em>);<br>
  <em>content</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>base</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong>; <br>
  <em>first</em>, <em>last</em>: <em>integer</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p> It takes as parameters the size of the array (i.e. the number of variables) 
  and a value which is the initial value for each. </p>
<p><strong>let</strong> <em>v</em> == <em>vector</em>(10, &quot;init&quot;)</p>
<p>A particular variable is selected by applying the <em>sub</em> procedure to 
  a number between 1 and the size (the <strong>index</strong>). The result will 
  be a variable which can be assigned a value, or its value can be read. </p>
<p><em>v</em>$<em>sub</em>(4)<br>
  <em>v</em>$<em>sub</em>(5) := &quot;new string&quot;</p>
<p>Attempting to apply <em>sub</em> to a value outside the range causes a <em>subscript</em> 
  exception.</p>
<p><em>first</em> and <em>last</em>
  are two integer values that are set to the
  minimum and maximum index values (1 and the size respectively).
  If the size parameter given to <em>vector</em> is less than 1 it will raise
  a <em>range</em> exception.</p>
  
<h3>8.3. Iterators</h3>
<p>Many programs involve the processing of lists or sets of values processing 
  each one or searching for one which satisfies some condition. The standard header 
  contains definitions to make these easier. All of these work using a standard 
  interface, a type, called an <strong>iterator</strong> which represents an abstract 
  sequence of values. An iterator has the following signature. 
<p><strong>type</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<br>
  <em>continue</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>init</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>iterator</em>;<br>
  <em>next</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>iterator</em>;<br>
  <em>value</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>base_type</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong>
<p>Values of the iterator type are elements of a sequence such that each has a 
  value of some base type associated with it and a way of getting to the next 
  element. They can be regarded as elements of a list, but equally they can be 
  a range of integer values. <em>init</em> generates the first element of the 
  sequence, and <em>continue</em> tests it to see if is a valid entry (the sequence 
  may be empty or exhausted). If it is valid then <em>value</em> may be used to 
  extract the associated value and <em>next</em> used to return the next element 
  in the sequence. To see how this works we will examine two procedures which 
  use iterators. </p>
<h4>8.3.1. for</h4>
<p>The <em>for</em> procedure is designed to apply a given procedure to every 
  member of a sequence. Its signature is
<p><em>for</em> : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>[</strong><em>base</em> : <strong>type</strong> 
  <strong>end</strong> <strong>]</strong><br>
  (<em>iterator</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<br>
  <em>continue</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>init</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>iterator</em>;<br>
  <em>next</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>iterator</em>;<br>
  <em>value</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>base</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong>; <br>
  <em>body</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>base</em>)) 
<p>It takes an iterator and applies the procedure <em>body</em> to each element 
  in turn. The body of <em>for</em> in Poly is 
<p><strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>letrec</strong> <em>successor</em> ==<br>
  { Loop until the condition is false }<br>
  <strong>proc</strong> <strong>inline</strong> (<em>counter</em>: <em>iterator</em>)<br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <strong>if</strong> <em>counter</em>.<em>continue</em><br>
  <strong>then</strong><br>
  <strong>begin</strong><br>
  <em>body</em>(<em>counter</em>.<em>value</em>);<br>
  <em>successor</em>(<em>counter</em>.<em>next</em>)<br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong> { successor }; <br>
  <em>successor</em>(<em>iterator</em>$<em>init</em>()) { The initial value of 
  the iterator. }<br>
  <strong>end</strong> { for }; 
<p>The <em>successor</em> loops generating elements of the sequence and applying 
  <em>body</em> to each value until the sequence is exhausted. </p>
<h4>8.3.2. first</h4>
<p>The other procedure which operates on iterators is <em>first</em> which searches 
  a sequence until a condition is found. It has signature </p>
<p><em>first</em> : <strong>proc</strong> <strong>[</strong><em>base</em>, <em>result</em>: 
  <strong>type</strong> <strong>end</strong> <strong>]</strong><br>
  (<em>iterator</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<br>
  <em>continue</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>init</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>iterator</em>;<br>
  <em>next</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>iterator</em>;<br>
  <em>value</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iterator</em>)<em>base</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong>;<br>
  <em>test</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>base</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>success</em>: <strong>proc</strong> (<em>base</em>)<em>result</em>;<br>
  <em>failure</em>: <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>result</em><br>
  )<em>result</em></p>
<p> As well as the iterator, <em>first</em> takes three other explicit parameters, 
  all procedures. The first is the test which is applied to each value. If it 
  succeeds (returns <em>true</em>) then the <em>success</em> procedure is called 
  with the value as its parameter. If the sequence is exhausted before the test 
  has succeeded the <em>failure</em> procedure is invoked. The result of <em>first</em> 
  is the result of either <em>success</em> or <em>failure</em>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Compiler and Environment</h2>

<p>This part of the system is still under development and is not guaranteed to
  remain stable.
  Parts of it are also heavily UNIX dependent.</p>
<p>The current environment support provides facilities for compiling text files
  and remaking a system from its composite modules, compiling those which have
  been modified.
  There is a simple history mechanism for re-executing commands.</p>
<p>The system is used interactively with Poly expressions and declarations being
  typed in by the user and the reponses printed by the computer.
  Poly is used as a command language as well as a programming language, so all
  commands are simply Poly procedure calls and have their signatures checked
  by the compiler.
  Commands must either return values of type <em>void</em>, in which case they 
  are
  simply executed, or they must return values of a type which has a print
  operation so that the result can be printed.
  Variables and procedures with no parameters are allowed provided their results
  are void or can be printed.</p>
  
<h3>9.1. environ</h3>

<p><em>environ</em> is the type which is the nearest equivalent to a file directory
  in Poly.
  It has signature
  </p>
<p> <em>environ</em> :<br>
  <strong>type</strong> (<em>environ</em>)<br>
  <em>enter</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>environ</em>; <em>string</em>; <em>declaration</em>);<br>
  <em>lookup</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>environ</em>; <em>string</em>)<em>declaration</em>;<br>
  <em>delete</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>environ</em>; <em>string</em>);<br>
  <em>print</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>environ</em>);<br>
  <em>in</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<br>
  <strong>type</strong><br>
  <em>enter</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>; <em>declaration</em>);<br>
  <em>lookup</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>declaration</em>;<br>
  <em>delete</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>);<br>
  <em>over</em> : <strong>type</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<br>
  <em>continue</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>init</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>iter</em>;<br>
  <em>next</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<em>iter</em>;<br>
  <em>value</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<em>declaration</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  )<em>environ</em>;<br>
  <em>out</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>environ</em>)<br>
  <strong>type</strong><br>
  <em>enter</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>; <em>declaration</em>);<br>
  <em>lookup</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)<em>declaration</em>;<br>
  <em>delete</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>);<br>
  <em>over</em> : <strong>type</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<br>
  <em>continue</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<em>boolean</em>;<br>
  <em>init</em> : <strong>proc</strong> ()<em>iter</em>;<br>
  <em>next</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<em>iter</em>;<br>
  <em>value</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>iter</em>)<em>declaration</em><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong><br>
  <strong>end</strong></p>
<p><em>declaration</em> is a type which the compiler uses to represent objects 
  that it has created.</p>
<p>A value of the <em>environ</em> type is a set of procedures which
  map strings onto <em>declaration</em> values.
  The compiler uses the value of <em>current_env</em> as the environment in which
  to compile something.
  It uses the <em>lookup</em> procedure to find the value and signature of
  identifiers and calls <em>enter</em> to store the result of making declarations.
  A particular value of the environ type is made by using the <em>in</em> procedure
  to package up a type with the appropriate operations.
  The inverse operation <em>out</em> can be used to extract the type.</p>
<p>There is a procedure <em>mkenv</em> which can be used to create environ values.
  It has signature
  </p>
<p> <em>mkenv</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>environ</em>)<em>environ</em></p>
<p>It returns an environment which can be seen as an extension of the environment 
  which was given as the parameter. New declarations result in entries in this 
  new environment and they can be found by using the identifier. However, looking 
  up an identifier which has not been declared in this environment results in 
  a search in the environment originally passed as the parameter. This can be 
  regarded in the same way as nested declarations in Poly where an identifier 
  is first looked up in the current block and if it is not found there the enclosing 
  blocks are searched. Typically <em>mkenv</em> is called with either the current 
  environment or the global environment as parameter. </p>
<p> <strong>let</strong> <em>new_env</em> == <em>mkenv</em>(<em>current_env</em>);<br>
  <em>current_env</em> := <em>newenv</em>;<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>new_env</em> == <em>mkenv</em>(<em>global_env</em>); 
</p>
<p>The global environment contains declarations such as integer which it is expected 
  that nearly all programs will require.</p>
<p>The computation involved when entering or looking up an identifier may be
  considerably more than just operating on a table.
  The <em>make</em> procedure, for example, uses an environment in which looking 
  up
  an identifier may involve recursive calls to the compiler to compile the
  object.</p>
  
<h3>9.2. ?</h3>

<p>? prints the signature of an object which has previously been declared. It 
  has signature </p>
<p> ? : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)</p>
<p>For example, the statement </p>
<p> ? &quot;?&quot;;</p>
<p>prints </p>
<p> ? : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)
<p> It is useful to be able to check the signature of an object before using it. </p>
<h3>9.3. #</h3>

<p># runs a text file through the compiler and executes the result. It has signature 
</p>
<p> \# : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>) 
<p>At present the string parameter it takes is an ordinary UNIX file name, without 
  any processing of wild-cards. </p>
<h3>9.4. sh</h3>
<p><em>sh</em> runs a line of text through the UNIX shell.
  It can be used to execute any command, including starting up interactive
  programs.
  It has signature
  </p>
<p> <em>sh</em> : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<p> <em>sh</em> &quot;emacs fred&quot;;
<p>will start up and run the "emacs" editor on a file called "fred". The Poly 
  system will wait until the process is finished before continuing. </p>
<h3>9.5. make</h3>
<p>The <em>make</em> command in Poly is similar in function to the "make" command
  under UNIX.
  It constructs a Poly object by recompiling only those parts of it which have
  changed since it was last made.</p>
<p>It is generally good programming practice to break a large program down into
  several parts, usually called modules, and develop each independently.
  A module usually provides several related functions and so can be represented
  in Poly as a "type".
  Such types may or may not have values belonging to them.
  For example, a module to construct stacks could be the type "stack" and all
  stacks would be of that type, but a module for a set of trigonometrical
  functions would be simply a set of related procedures.</p>
<p>A module may be complete in itself or require other modules to make it work.
  The latter case is represented in Poly by a procedure which takes some types
  as parameters and returns a type as the result.
  So, for example, a module for a parser may use modules for the symbols and for
  the parse tree.</p>
<p>An important point about these modules is that each can be compiled
  independently and then the program can be made by applying the modules which
  are procedures to their parameters.
  The process of applying a module to other modules is known as <em>binding</em>.
  Like any other procedure application in Poly it is subject to the normal rules
  for signature matching.</p>
<p>When a module is changed, for example to correct a bug, it must be recompiled
  and rebound.
  The purpose of the make procedure is to ensure that everything which must be
  recompiled has been and to rebind all the necessary modules.
  Note that a change to the signature of the module may require changes to
  other modules that use it, otherwise a signature fault may be generated by
  the compiler.
  A change of signature may not always require all the using modules to be
  recompiled.
  For example, a module which is a type may have several operations used by
  different using modules.
  Changing the signature of one of these operations will require changes
  only to those modules which actually use that operation.</p>
<p>The make procedure assumes that the source text of the modules is held in some
  UNIX text files in a set of related directories.
  As an example suppose we have a set of modules which are combined in the
  following fashion to make a program.
  </p>
<p> <strong>let</strong> <em>a</em> == <em>b</em>(<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>e</em> == <em>f</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>h</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>i</em> == <em>j</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>h</em>);<br>
  <strong>let</strong> <em>z</em> == <em>k</em>(<em>i</em>, <em>e</em>); </p>
<p><em>z</em> is the result of binding the modules together and is the final program. 
  The source text is arranged in a series of directories with the root directory 
  called <strong>z</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>z</strong> contains <strong>k</strong>, <strong>i</strong> and <strong>e</strong> 
  and <strong>h</strong>.<br>
  <strong>z/k</strong> is the source text for <em>k</em>.<br>
  <strong>z/i</strong> is a directory containing <strong>j</strong> and <strong>a</strong>.<br>
  <strong>z/i/j</strong> is the source text for <em>j</em>.<br>
  <strong>z/i/a</strong> is a directory containing source files <strong>b</strong>, 
  <strong>c</strong> and <strong> d</strong>. }<br>
  <strong>z/e</strong> is a directory containing source texts <strong>f</strong> 
  and <strong>g</strong>.<br>
  <strong>z/h</strong> is the source text for <em>h</em>.</p>
<p>In addition each directory has a file called <strong>poly_bind</strong> which 
  are the instructions for binding together the modules to make the result. </p>
<p> <strong>z/poly_bind</strong> contains "<strong>let</strong> <em>z</em> == 
  <em>k</em>(<em>i</em>, <em>e</em>);"<br>
  <strong>i/poly_bind</strong> contains "<strong>let</strong> <em>i</em> == <em>j</em>(<em>a</em>, 
  <em>e</em>, <em>h</em>);"<br>
  <strong>e/poly_bind</strong> contains "<strong>let</strong> <em>e</em> == <em>f</em>(<em>g</em>, 
  <em>h</em>);"<br>
  <strong>a/poly_bind</strong> contains "<strong>let</strong> <em>a</em> == <em>b</em>(<em>c</em>, 
  <em>d</em>);"</p>
<p>Supposing <strong>h</strong> has been modified and we wish to remake <em>z</em>.
  The command
  </p>
<p> <em>make</em> &quot;z&quot;; </p>
<p>looks for a file "<em>z</em>" and examines its access permission. It discovers 
  that it is a directory and so tries to compile the file "<em>z</em>/poly_bind". 
  This contains the command </p>
<p> <strong>let</strong> <em>z</em> == <em>k</em>(<em>i</em>, <em>e</em>);</p>
<p> For each identifier in the command it looks up a file with that name in the 
  current directory and only if that fails does it treat it as an ordinary identifier. 
  <strong>k</strong> is a text file so it compares the time that it was last modified 
  (kept by the operating system) with the time on which an identifier called <em>k</em> 
  was last declared (kept by the Poly system). It sees that the file has not been 
  modified since <em>k</em> was declared so it uses that declaration. If it had 
  found that the file was newer it would recompile <strong>k</strong> (by a recursive 
  call to the compiler) before returning the newly compiled version. It does not 
  perform any other consistency checks relying on the type checking to ensure 
  that <em>k</em> really is a procedure which can correctly be applied to <em>i</em> 
  and <em>e</em>.</p>
<p>It next encounters <em>i</em> which it discovers is a directory and so it executes
  the file <strong>z/i/poly_bind</strong>.
  <strong>j</strong> is treated in the same way as <strong>k</strong>, but <strong>a</strong> is again a directory.
  It recurses again to process <strong>a</strong> and checks <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong> and <strong>d</strong>.
  Finding that all these are text files and are up to date and that <em>a</em> 
  is
  newer than each of them, it concludes that <em>a</em> is up to date and uses 
  its
  current value without rebinding.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>, being a directory, is processed in the same way as <strong>a</strong>.
  <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> are both found to be up to date, but <strong>h</strong> is not 
  found in the
  directory.
  The directories are regarded as nested blocks so that if a file is not found
  in the current directory the make program looks in the immediately enclosing
  one (i.e. the parent directory).
  It fails to find <strong>h</strong> in <strong>i</strong> and so tries <strong>z</strong>.
  There it finds the source text for <em>h</em> and discovers that it has been
  modified and must be recompiled.
  It recompiles it, returning the newly compiled <em>h</em> as its result.
  <em>e</em> must now be rebound so the declaration is executed and the new value
  returned as the result.</p>
<p>The next identifier in the declaration of <em>i</em> is <em>h</em> itself.
  The program remembers that <em>h</em> has been checked and uses the new
  value, rather than repeating the check on when the files were modified.
  It does this whether it has recompiled the file or just checked that it does
  not need recompiling.
  It executes the declaration of <em>i</em> because <em>e</em> and <em>h</em> have 
  been remade
  and returns this as its result.</p>
<p>In the declaration of <em>z</em> the next identifier is <em>e</em>.
  Again it uses the fact that <em>e</em> has been checked to save processing the
  declaration of <em>e</em> again.
  Finally it can rebind <em>z</em> and the construction is complete.
  If make is rerun immediately after this it will simply check everything and
  not rebind any of the files.</p>
<p>Note that each file must be "in scope" when it is required.
  Because <strong>h</strong> is used by both <strong>i</strong> and <strong>e</strong> it must be in the path to 
  both
  of them i.e. in the <strong>z</strong> directory.</p>
  
<h3>9.6. Persistent Storage</h3>
<p>The Poly system runs under a persistent storage system, that is any declarations 
  of identifiers or values in variables can be retained from one session to the 
  next on permanent storage. The database is held on a file and objects are read 
  in from it as required. Once read in they are retained in store until the end 
  of the session when those which are to be retained are written out again. The 
  criterion for writing something out to the database is whether it is reachable 
  from the root procedure which is the one used when Poly is started up. In the 
  normal Poly system this essentially means that any declarations made in the 
  global environment will be retained. When the user exits normally from Poly 
  all the reachable objects are written back and the database is updated. The 
  database can also be written back by executing the procedure <em>commit</em>();<em> 
  </em>which writes back the database and exits from Poly. It is currently not 
  possible to write the database and continue. </p>
<h3>9.7. history</h3>

<p>The normal Poly system reads commands from the input stream, usually the
terminal, and compiles and executes them.
It also remembers the last few commands typed so that they can be re-executed
if necessary.
The commands in the table can be printed by the <em>history</em> procedure.
</p>
<p> <em>history</em>();</p>
<p>There are three procedures which execute commands from the history table. Each 
  command prints the command before executing it, and also enters the command 
  it will execute in the history table. The previous command can be executed by 
  the !!procedure. </p>
<p> !!(); </p>
<p>Another command can be executed using the <strong>!-</strong> procedure. It 
  has signature </p>
<p> !- : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>integer</em>) </p>
<p>The integer parameter is the number of the command counting back from the current 
  one, so </p>
<p> !- 1;</p>
<p> is equivalent to </p>
<p> !!(); </p>
<p> The third command <strong>!</strong> has signature </p>
<p> ! : <strong>proc</strong> (<em>string</em>)</p>
<p>The string is the first few characters of the command to be executed, so to 
  re-execute the last declaration, </p>
<p> ! "let";
<p>can be used. The command found is the first one whose characters match, working 
  from the last command back.
