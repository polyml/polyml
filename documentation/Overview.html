<h1>Overview of the Poly/ML Source Code</h1>
<p>Poly/ML has a history of over 25 years and the source has undergone many changes 
  in that time. Many of the file names no longer reflect the current function 
  of their code. This is intended as a brief introduction to the source code to 
  enable maintainers and those wanting to experiment with the code to find their 
  way round it. The source code is fairly well commented at the level of individual 
  statements.</p>
<p>The source code is comprised of three parts. The run-time system is written 
  in C++ with a small amount of assembly code. The compiler is written in Standard 
  ML and the basis library consists of several Standard ML files.</p>
<p>The source code changes with each release so the documentation will need to 
  be updated. This version reflects the state of the 5.4 release.</p>
<h2>The Poly/ML Compiler</h2>
<p>The Poly/ML compiler is written in Standard ML. Each file is a module, either 
  a signature, functor or structure whose name matches the name of the file. This 
  is a consequence of using the Poly/ML &quot;make&quot; system to build the compiler. 
  The larger modules will have a signature file, a functor which contains most 
  of the code and a small file which defines the structure as an application of 
  the functor to its arguments.</p>
<h3>Compiler control</h3>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/Debug.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/COMPILER_BODY.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CompilerBody.ML - Structure</p>
<p>CompilerBody is the main body of the compiler. The compiler consists of four 
  major passes but the final code-processing pass in particular involves several 
  minor passes. CompilerBody controls each of the major passes. The source code 
  is parsed into a parse-tree which is then type checked and subsequently code-generated 
  into a code-tree. The parsing, type-checking and code-generation passes may 
  each fail because of errors in the source and if one pass fails the later passes 
  are not attempted. The final pass which transforms and optimises the code-tree 
  and generates the final machine code will never fail unless there is an internal 
  compiler error.</p>
<p>Debug contains definitions of most of the &quot;tags&quot; that control the 
  compiler. These are the internal representation of the properties that may be 
  passed in to PolyML.compiler. Most of these are used to control the output of 
  debugging information.</p>
<h3>Identifiers</h3>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/STRUCTVALSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/STRUCT_VALS.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/StructVals.ML - Structure</p>
<p>StructVals contains the fundamental datatypes that describe all Poly/ML values, 
  types, type-constructors, functors, structures and signatures. These are all 
  entities that can appear in the top-level name space. The compiler operates 
  on name-spaces that contain these entities, looking up existing identifiers 
  and making new identifiers as a result of top-level declarations. The actual 
  &quot;values&quot; associated with values, functors or structures are described 
  using the CodeTree datatype (see BaseCodeTree). This allows for inline functions 
  to contain the full range of code. Structures are actually represented as tuples 
  and functors as functions, which by default are inline. As well as top-level 
  entities the datatypes also include versions of values and structures that occur 
  only during the compilation process.<br>
</p>
<h3>Lexical Analysis</h3>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/Symbols.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Syms.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/IntSet.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/SYM_SET.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/SymSet.ML - Structure</p>
<p>Symbols defines the ML reserved words. Syms, IntSet, SYM_SET and SymSet provide 
  a way of handling sets of symbols during parsing. </p>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/LEXSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/LEX_.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Lex.ML - Structure</p>
<p>The lexical analyser processes the input text skipping over comments and blank 
  space. It sets a group of refs to information about the current sysmbol.</p>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/PARSE_DEC.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ParseDec.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/PARSE_TYPE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ParseType.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/SKIPS_.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Skips.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/UTILITIES_.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Utilities.ML - Structure</p>
<p>ParseDec is the main recursive-descent parser. It calls in to the lexical analyser 
  to get the next symbol and calls functions in ParseTree, Signatures and Structures 
  to build the parse-tree as it goes. ParseType does this for the type-expressions 
  such as type constraints or in signatures. Skips and Utilities contain helper 
  functions for parsing. </p>
<h3>Parse Tree</h3>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/STRUCTURESSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/STRUCTURES_.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Structures.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/SIGNATURESSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/SIGNATURES.sml - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/SignaturesStruct.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/PARSETREESIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/PARSE_TREE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ParseTree.ML - Structure</p>
<p>The parser generates a tree structure to represent the source program during 
  the parsing pass. The type-checking and code-generation passes work on this 
  parse tree. ParseTree contains the definitions for the core language, Structures 
  the definitions for structures and functors and Signatures the definitions for 
  signatures. The datatypes for the parse tree are local to each of these modules 
  so each module contains all the code that needs to walk over the parse tree. 
  Each of these modules makes use of the parse tree support modules to perform 
  particular tasks.</p>
<h3>Type Checking</h3>
<p>mlsource/MLCompiler/TYPETREESIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/TYPE_TREE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/TypeTree.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/COPIERSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/COPIER.sml - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CopierStruct.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/PRINT_TABLE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/PrintTable.ML - Structure</p>
<p>TypeTree contains the main type-checking code and various other functions to 
  support operations on types. Copier is used to make a copy of a signature when 
  it is instantiated to a structure. PrintTable contains a list of current overloadings 
  of overloaded operations. Previously this included user-provided pretty-printers 
  but this has now been removed.</p>
<h3>Parse Tree Support</h3>
<p> mlsource/MLCompiler/VALUEOPSSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/VALUE_OPS.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ValueOps.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/PRETTYSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Pretty.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/DATATYPEREPSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/DATATYPE_REP.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/DatatypeRep.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/EXPORTTREESIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ExportTree.sml - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ExportTreeStruct.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/TYPEIDCODESIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/TYPEIDCODE.sml - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/TypeIDCodeStruct.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/DEBUGGERSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/DEBUGGER_.sml - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Debugger.sml - Structure</p>
<p>There are various support modules involved in the process of type-checking 
  and code-generation. ValueOps contains operations on identifiers. As well as 
  simple identifiers it also deals with various sorts of overloaded identifiers 
  as well as the type-specific functions such as PolyML.print. It contains many 
  of the functions to display ML values. Pretty defines the type used in the Poly/ML 
  pretty printer. DatatypeRep produces an optimised representation for the value 
  constructors of a datatype depending on the number and types of the constructors. 
  ExportTree is used in the construction of the abstract view of the parse-tree 
  that is made available through the IDE interface. TYPEIDCODE produces code for 
  the type-identifiers associated with types and datatypes. These contain the 
  type-specific printing and equality functions. Debugger is used to build the 
  data structures and hooks used for debugging ML code if the code is compiled 
  with PolyML.Compiler.debug set.</p>
<h3> Code Generation </h3>
<p> mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/BaseCodeTreeSig.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/BaseCodeTree.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CODETREESIG.ML - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CODETREE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/ml_bind.ML - Structure</p>
<p>The third pass of the compiler generates an intermediate code structure from 
  the parse-tree. BaseCodeTree contains the datatype definition for this structure 
  and a few additional functions. CODETREE contains the optimiser and processing 
  functions that transform the tree structure generated from the ML code into 
  an equivalent tree structure for the low-level code generator. The optimise 
  function performs inline function expansion, tuple optimisation and various 
  constant folding operations. Later passes remove redundant declarations especially 
  those added as part of the inline expansion process and compute life-time values 
  for the remaining declarations. Life-time information is used by the low-level 
  code-generator to aid register allocation.<br>
</p>
<h3>Code Generation - X86</h3>
<p> mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CODE_ARRAY.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CODEGEN_TABLESIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CODEGEN_TABLE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CodeGenTable.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CODECONSSIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/X86CODESIG.sml - Signature<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/X86OUTPUTCODE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/X86OPTIMISE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/X86LOWLEVEL.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/GENERATE_CODE.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/GCode.i386.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/CodeTree/CodeCons.i386.ML - Structure</p>
  <p>
  The final part of the compilation process is to generate machine code for the 
  particular architecture. GCode (GENERATE_CODE) processes the code-tree and builds 
  a list of instructions. CodeGenTable is used to keep track of declarations and 
  register allocations. X86LOWLEVEL is the first part of this process. X86OPTIMISE 
  is a peep-hole optimiser that looks for sequences of instructions that can be 
  reduced. The final part of the process is handled by X86OUTPUTCODE which takes 
  the instruction sequence and produces a code-object, a vector containing the 
  X86 machine code and also the constants used in the code. CODE_ARRAY is a helper 
  structure that provides byte and word operations on the code-object.</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
<p> mlsource/MLCompiler/CompilerVersion.sml - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/MAKE_.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Make.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/INITIALISE_.ML - Functor<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Initialise.ML - Structure<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/ml_bind.ML</p>
<p>CompilerVersion is a tiny structure with the current version information. Make 
  is a wrapper for the compiler and includes a cut-down version of the &quot;use&quot; 
  function to enable the basis library to be compiled. Initialise contains declarations 
  needed for bootstrapping. Before the basis library can be compiled there are 
  certain identifiers that have to be added to the initial name-space. In particular, 
  the compiler itself and various compiler switches and datatypes have to added 
  at this stage. ml_bind is the root when building the compiler using PolyML.make. 
  It sets up the compiler for bootstrapping.
</p>
<h3>Support Library</h3>
<p> mlsource/MLCompiler/Boot/Address.ML<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Boot/Misc.ML<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Boot/HashTable.ML<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Boot/UniversalTable.ML<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Boot/StretchArray.ML<br>
  mlsource/MLCompiler/Boot/ml_bind.ML</p>
<p>The Boot directory contains a few library structures that are used throughout 
  the compiler. These are gradually being replaced by the Standard Basis Library.</p>
<h2>The Run-time System</h2>
<p>The Poly/ML run-time system (RTS) is written mostly in C++ with a few files 
  in C and assembly code. All interaction between ML code and the operating system 
  goes through the run-time system. Most interaction is through RTS calls.</p>
<h3>Stub Functions</h3>
<p> libpolymain/polystub.c<br>
  polyimport.c </p>
<p>Every executable program has to have an initial entry point, (main or WinMain) 
  and this is provided by either polyimport or polystub. polystub is used to create 
  the polymain library. All other RTS files are compiled into the polyml library. 
  polyimport is normally only used during the initial installation and reads a 
  heap that has been exported in the portable (text) format. polystub is used 
  when building an executable by linking in an object file that has been exported 
  with PolyML.export.</p>
<h3>Globals and Support Modules</h3>
<p>libpolyml/mpoly.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/mpoly.h<br>
  libpolyml/run_time.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/run_time.h <br>
  libpolyml/diagnostics.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/diagnostics.h <br>
  libpolyml/rts_module.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/rts_module.h<br>
  libpolyml/globals.h<br>
  libpolyml/noreturn.h<br>
  libpolyml/sys.h<br>
  libpolyml/version.h<br>
  config.h<br>
  winconfig.h</p>
<p>mpoly.cpp contains the main entry point to the RTS and is immediately called 
  by the main program in either polyimport or polystub. run_time.cpp contains 
  the main despatch table for RTS calls from ML code and also various functions 
  that do not fit elsewhere. diagnostics.cpp contains some functions to produce 
  debugging information from the RTS. rts_module defines the RTSModule base class 
  that is used for the more specific modules. sys.h provides symbolic definitions 
  for run-time system calls. The information in it should match basis/RuntimeCalls.ML. 
  globals.h defines the PolyWord and PolyObject classes that provide symbolic 
  access to machine words as well as other global definitions. noreturn.h provides 
  a way of indicating that a function does not return normally. version.h is a 
  small file containing the current RTS version. config.h is produced automatically 
  by the configuration process. winconfig.h is an equivalent for Windows when 
  compiling under Visual C++.</p>
<h3>Arithmetic and Strings</h3>
<p>libpolyml/arb.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/arb.h<br>
  libpolyml/reals.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/reals.h<br>
  libpolyml/realconv.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/realconv.h<br>
  libpolyml/polystring.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/polystring.h</p>
<p>arg.cpp contains the arbitrary precision package. It now uses GMP to do the 
  actual arithmetic if GMP is installed and otherwise uses its own code. reals.cpp 
  contains real number (floating point) operations. realconv is a slightly modified 
  version of the real to string conversion functions written by David M. Gay.</p>
<h3>Basis Library Support</h3>
<p>libpolyml/process_env.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/timing.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/process_env.h<br>
  libpolyml/timing.h <br>
  libpolyml/io_internal.h<br>
  libpolyml/basicio.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/network.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/basicio.h<br>
  libpolyml/network.h<br>
  libpolyml/errors.h</p>
<p>libpolyml/proper_io.h<br>
  libpolyml/proper_io.cpp</p>
<p>These files contain the operating system interfaces needed to support the Standard 
  Basis Library. proper_io.cpp contains some wrap-around functions to avoid bugs 
  and inconsistencies in some operating system calls. errors.h contains a table 
  that maps between error numbers (the value stored in errno on Unix) and their 
  textual equivalents.</p>
<h3>State Saving and Exporting</h3>
<p>polyexports.h<br>
  libpolyml/exporter.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/exporter.h<br>
  libpolyml/elfexport.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/elfexport.h<br>
  libpolyml/machoexport.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/machoexport.h<br>
  libpolyml/pecoffexport.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/pecoffexport.h<br>
  libpolyml/pexport.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/pexport.h<br>
  libpolyml/sharedata.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/sharedata.h<br>
  libpolyml/savestate.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/savestate.h</p>
<p>These files provide mechanisms for exporting the heap in various forms. Different 
  operating systems use different formats for object modules: ELF on Linux and 
  BSD Unix, Mach-O on Mac OS X and PE-COFF on Windows. Poly/ML also has its own 
  portable text format that is usually used only for the initial installation 
  and pexport.cpp contains the code to both export and import this format. sharedata.cpp 
  is used to reduce the size of the heap by combining values that are equivalent. 
  Although not strictly related to exporting it is usually used before a heap 
  is exported. savestate.cpp contains code to export and import the heap as a 
  saved state.</p>
<h3>Operating-System Specific</h3>
<p>libpolyml/Console.h<br>
  libpolyml/Console.cpp<br>
  resource.h<br>
  PolyML.rc <br>
  libpolyml/PolyControl.h <br>
  libpolyml/windows_specific.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/unix_specific.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/xwindows.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/xcall_numbers.h<br>
  libpolyml/xwindows.h<br>
  libpolyml/os_specific.h</p>
<p>Parts of the RTS are specific to either Windows or to Posix platforms i.e. 
  Unix and Cygwin. unix_specific.cpp contains code to support the Unix and Posix 
  structures in the basis library. windows_specific.cpp supports the Windows structure. 
  Console.cpp provides a simple console window in Windows and PolyML.rc is the 
  resource file with the menus and icons. xwindows.cpp contains the X-Windows 
  and Motif interface. It is only included if the appropriate configuration option 
  is set.</p>
<h3>Hardware Specific</h3>
<p>libpolyml/machine_dep.h<br>
  libpolyml/x86_dep.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/x86asm.asm <br>
  libpolyml/power_dep.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/power_assembly.S<br>
  libpolyml/sparc_dep.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/sparc_assembly.S<br>
  libpolyml/int_opcodes.h<br>
  libpolyml/interpret.cpp</p>
<p>Poly/ML is compiled into machine code and uses its own linkage conventions. 
  When calling from ML to the RTS there needs to be an interface which saves the 
  ML state and loads the C state for the RTS. Arguments and results need to be 
  transferred. There is a C++ file and an assembly code file for each of the X86 
  (32 and 64-bit), PPC and Sparc architectures. On other architectures a portable, 
  interpreted byte code is used and the interpreter takes the place of the machine-specific 
  module.</p>
<h3>Multi-Threading</h3>
<p>libpolyml/processes.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/processes.h <br>
  libpolyml/locking.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/locking.h
</p>
<p>Support for multi-threading is mostly contained in processes.cpp. locking.cpp 
  provides implementation for the PLock, Plocker and PCondVar classes that are 
  used in various places to provide mutual exclusion.</p>
<h3>Memory Management</h3>
<p>libpolyml/gc.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/gc.h<br>
  libpolyml/bitmap.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/bitmap.h<br>
  libpolyml/memmgr.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/memmgr.h<br>
  libpolyml/osmem.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/osmem.h<br>
  libpolyml/save_vec.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/save_vec.h<br>
  libpolyml/scanaddrs.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/scanaddrs.h <br>
  libpolyml/check_objects.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/check_objects.h
</p>
<p>The main part of the garbage collector is in gc.cpp. bitmap.cpp provides the 
  Bitmap class that is used to mark allocated words in the memory. memmgr.cpp 
  provides classes to manage the various segments of memory: local segments for 
  local heaps and permanent segments for object file heaps and saved states. osmem.cpp 
  is used for the actual allocation and de-allocation of memory using calls specific 
  to the operating system. save_vec.cpp defines classes that support a save-vector 
  for each thread. When in the RTS a thread may need to allocate memory or access 
  values in the ML heap. It always does this through its save vector which may 
  be modified if there is a garbage collector. scanaddrs.cpp provides classes 
  process data structures in the heap by following pointers. This is used in the 
  garbage collector and also when exporting the heap. check_objects.cpp is used 
  for debugging.</p>
<h3>Poly/ML Extensions</h3>
<p>libpolyml/foreign.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/foreign.h<br>
  libpolyml/objsize.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/objsize.h<br>
  libpolyml/poly_specific.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/poly_specific.h<br>
  libpolyml/profiling.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/profiling.h<br>
  libpolyml/sighandler.cpp<br>
  libpolyml/sighandler.h </p>
<p>As well as the standard basis library Poly/ML contains various additional structures. 
  foreign.cpp contains the foreign-function interface (CInterface structure). 
  objsize.cpp supports PolyML.objSize and PolyML.showSize. poly_specific.cpp has 
  various additional functions. profiling.cpp supports profiling for time and 
  space. sighandler.cpp supports the Signal structure that allows an ML function 
  to be called as the result of a signal.</p>
<h2>Basis Library</h2>
<p>The basis library is compiled when Poly/ML is built for a particular platform. 
  Apart from the entries added by the initialisation process all entries in the 
  name space come from the basis library. The library is mostly compiled into 
  a basic name space created during the initialisation process. When this is complete 
  a new name space is built using functions from the basis library and all the 
  declarations are copied over with the exception of some of the support modules 
  that are only used internally in the basis library.</p>
<h3>Build control</h3>
<p>exportPoly.sml<br>
  basis/build.sml </p>
<p>These files are used to control the build process.</p>
<h3>Values and Infixes</h3>
<p>basis/InitialBasis.ML</p>
<p>Most of the library is arranged as modules (structure or functors and their 
  signatures). InitialBasis contains various values and infix declarations that 
  can appear free in the basis and in particular those that are needed to compile 
  the rest of the basis. A few additional value declarations are made later in 
  the process, in particular the General structure is opened after it has been 
  compiled. </p>
<h3>PolyML structure</h3>
<p>basis/InitialPolyML.ML<br>
  basis/PrettyPrinter.ML<br>
  basis/FinalPolyML.sml<br>
  basis/TopLevelPolyML.sml</p>
<p>The PolyML structure is unusual in that it is actually built in several phases. 
  There is a version of the structure created in the initialisation process that 
  contains special definitions such as PolyML.print that are infinitely overloaded 
  and cannot be written in ML. InitialPolyML is compiled at the start of building 
  the library and extends the structure to include some functions, such as onEntry, 
  that are used within the basis library itself. PrettyPrinter, FinalPolyML and 
  TopLevelPolyML are compiled after the rest of the basis library. PrettyPrinter 
  contains a pretty printer, FinalPolyML contains the definition of PolyML.compiler 
  and TopLevelPolyML contains code for the IDE protocol.</p>
<h3>Support Modules</h3>
<p>basis/LibraryIOSupport.sml<br>
  basis/LibrarySupport.sml<br>

  basis/VectorSliceOperations.sml <br>
  basis/PolyVectorOperations.sml<br>

  basis/SingleAssignment.sml<br>
  basis/Thread.sml<br>
  basis/Universal.ML<br>
  basis/UniversalArray.ML<br>
  basis/Weak.sml<br>
  basis/HashArray.ML<br>
  basis/processes.ML<br>
  basis/SML90.sml
</p>
<p>These are extensions added by the Poly/ML system. RuntimeCalls lists the RTS 
  call numbers. <a href="/docs/Signal.html">Signal</a> provides a way to handle 
  Unix signals (and console interrupts in Windows). SingleAssignment provides 
  a reference that can be assigned to once. <a href="/docs/Threads.html">Thread</a> 
  provides multi-threading and processes contains a definition of the old Poly/ML 
  Process structure for backwards compatibility. Weak provides weak references 
  i.e. references that can be used to detect when a value is no longer referenced. 
  HashArray provides a hash table structure. SML90 provides backwards compatibility 
  for ML/90. It was defined in the original standard basis document but later 
  removed. <br>
